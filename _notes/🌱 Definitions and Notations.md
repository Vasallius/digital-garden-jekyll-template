# 🌱 Definitions and Notations

## set definition
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201029081045.png]]
	- uppercase for set name
	- lowercase for set elements

## set membership
- x ∈ S - element x is contained in set S
- x ∉ S - element x is not contained in set S

## buiding sets
- **roster method**
	- we write the elements in braces
	- use ellipsis when general pattern is obvious
	- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201029081433.png]]
- **rule method/set-builder notation**
	- characterize elements by stating the property they musth ave to be members
	- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201029081449.png]]
- set notations for some number sets
