>Cognitive tools only offload our cognition, but they donâ€™t have the ability to know, think, and understand. They do extend our cognitive capabilities, but we still do the thinking. (Dror & Harnad, 2008)

Whatever tool we use, we must use it in a way that it facilitates the way we think, know, and understand. They aid us think, but they do not think for us. As long as we fulfill the [[Goal of note-taking]], then we are fine.
