Just because there is raw energy needed for the amino acids construction into proteins doesn't mean it would magically arrange themselves. 

Paul Davies uses this analogy:
![[Pasted image 281.png]]

The chance of getting an amino acid in the right order is `1/20`, and the chance of getting 100 amino acids in order is `(1/20)^100`. And we know that we require hundreds of thousands of protein putting the probability of blind chance to `10^40,000`.

These odds are similar to producing a Boeing 747 jet aircraft in a junkyard after a tornado sweeps through it.
