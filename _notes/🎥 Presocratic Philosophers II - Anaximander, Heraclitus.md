Taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IRy3E-BZhY

## anaximander
- **theorized that all animal species first arose from air vapor**
- human beings have origins in the sea
- back in the primordial times, there arose fish and humans grew from them
	- fish ⇒ fish-like humans ⇒ man and women
- he noticed everything that exists comes into being then passes away
- *darkness gives rise to light and light collapses into darkness*
	- heat and cold
	- white and black
	- life and death
- water was volatile and was transforming into different forms
	- was supposed to be the foundation of all existence
- what was creating these things?
	- could not come from nothingness
	- where do they go when they disappear
- if things cannot come from nothingness, they cannot go into nothingness either
- **there must be a universal substance in which everything comes from and everything goes away**
- ✨ **Apeiron** (/əˈpaɪrɒn/; ἄπειρον)
	- limitless
	- infinite
	- indefinite
- the *limitless* spawns all things of nature and receives them as well
- the *limitless* always has been and always will be
- however, we are unaware of its presence
	- since unknowable
	- otherwise, it would come into being and pass away
- took philosophy further into the realm of abstraction
-** nature of the world is illusive to any direct comprehension**

## heraclitus of ephesus
- "the Sun is as big as it appears to be, the size of a human foot"
- tried curing an illness by burying himsef in manure
- like [[🎥 Presocratic Philosophers  I - Intro, Thales#thales of miletus|Thales]], believed that the universe was formed from one element
	- this element was **fire**
- assosciated fire with divine and eternal cosmos, the light-giving Sun, lightning, the moon, and other bright energies of the upper atmosphere
- every **human soul was made from a tiny amount of this heavenly fire**
- **everything came from fire and will return to it**
- **fire creates all the elements by transforming into them**
	- flame condenses to become air
	- vapors condense to become water
	- water condenses to become earth
	- elements can rise up using the same path	
		- reunite with the eternal fire from the sky
- water as a metaphor for different truth
	- *"you cannot stand in the same river twice"*
	- constantly flowing downstream
	- river is always a different river
- applied in a broader scale:
	- you cannot stand in the universe twice
	- **everything in the world is constantly changing**
	- everything was fleeting and impermanent
	- constant state of coming to be and passing away
		- some quickly
		- some over great span of time
- **only thing eternal and unbreakable was the cycle itself**
- humans eventually die, and along with them:
	- what they achieve
	- the nations they serve
	- memories of who they were
- Heraclitues withdrew from society and suffered deep depression
	- ***weeping philosopher***
- all human life is like a river and the river is always flowing
