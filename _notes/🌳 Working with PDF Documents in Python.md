### **Summary**

---

Text information isnâ€™t just for plaintext files; in fact, itâ€™s pretty likely that you deal with PDFs and Word documents much more often. You can use the PyPDF2 module to read and write PDF documents. Unfortunately, reading text from PDF documents might not always result in a perfect translation to a string because of the complicated PDF file format, and some PDFs might not be readable at all. In these cases, youâ€™re out of luck unless future updates to PyPDF2 support additional PDF features.
