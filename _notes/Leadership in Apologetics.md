Defending and giving an answer = apologetics

What leadersip contexts must be paramount?
1. [[Intellectual Leadership]]
2. [[Theological Leadership]]
3. [[Spiritual Leadership ]]


What are we to do in these leadership contexts?
1. They are contexts of exemplarity.
2. They are contexts of theory & practice.
3. They are contexts of growth or development.
4. They are contexts of preparation & engagement.
5. They are contexts of prayer & intercession.

The 4Hs are **Hear**, **Help**, **Heal**, and **Honor**. It moves from understanding the argument (hear), refuting with negative apologetics (help), building a case with positive apologetics (heal) and connecting the positive apologetics to the Gospel (honor).
