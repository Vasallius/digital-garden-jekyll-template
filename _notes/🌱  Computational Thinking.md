- looking at a problem in a way that computer can help us solve them
- important skills
	- logical reasoning
	- decomposition
	- generalisation
	- algorithms
	- abstraction
- example:
	- guess my number
		- random guessing and avoid what has already been guessed
			- very slow
		- linear search
			- start from the beginning
			- very slow
		- divide and conquer pattern
			- faster
			- pick midpoint whether > or <

- decomposition
	- break down into smaller parts
- pattern recognition
	- identify trends
- abstraction
	- identify specific similar and differences
	- can express the problem as an equation
- algorithm design
	- step by step instructions 
		- that can be used again to solve similar problems
