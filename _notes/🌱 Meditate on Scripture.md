	When we read scripture we must meditate on it and internalize it and in doing so we can find rest in the Almighty, a place where there is refuge and safety. A place where can be at ease, a place where we can feel His presence intimately. In the business of life we often forget to set an intent of purely focused and undistracted study of the Bible.
