### And Do You Not Remember?

#### Scripture
Mark 8:13-21; 6:47-52; 7:14-18

#### Observation

>How many times did Jesus question His disciples about their lack of
understanding and what is the significance of the repetition (vv.17-19, 21)?

Despite being with Jesus for a long period of time and seeing him perform miracles, the disciples still had a hard time understanding what Jesus was capable of.

Similar to us, as we go through life we go through a phase of *spiritual forgetness*, we forget all the good things Jesus had done for us. This is a result of **not understanding who Jesus really is**. That is why, let us conconsciously, constantly and conscientiously look at Jesus to understand Him as He truly is.

#### Application

>In what ways is spiritual forgetfulness a problem in my discipleship journey and how will I deal with it?

I will try to from time to time remember all the things Jesus has done for me and continuously try to understand Him for who He really is, not just some wish-granting genie.

#### Prayer

*Lord, I am like your disciples, help me not forget all the things you have done for me. Help me to know You for who You truly are. Lord, thank you for leading me to CEFC's Devotional Journal. Thank you that you given me another day to live again, I shall forever be grateful. Lord, I pray for those who barely have the means to survive in this COVID-19 pandemic. Help them and sustain them. Lord, I pray for the government, I know you are in control and will always be, help me to trust You. Amen.*
