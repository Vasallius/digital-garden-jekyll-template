Doctrine - a set of beliefs 

- Why is this important?
- What should we know?
- How should we respond? Hggg

## Why study the doctrines?

*Matthew 22:37 (NASB)*

37 And He said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’

To love God, we need to know Him.

## CCF Statement of Faith about the Bible

We believe that the Bible, composed of 39 Old Testament books and 27 New Testament books, is the **Word of God**, **supernaturally inspired**, **inerrant** in its original form, **infallible**, so that it is our **supreme authority** in all matters of faith, doctrine and conduct.

### 1. The Bible claims to be authoritative because it is God’s Word.

>16 All Scripture is inspired by God (`theopneustos`: "divinely breathed into") and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
*2 Timothy 3:16-17*

**Inspiration** is the work of the Holy Spirit to guide the authors of the Bible to compose and record in words, without error, God’s revelation to man.

>**16** For we did **not follow cleverly devised tales** when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but **we were eyewitnesses** of His majesty. **17** For when He received honor and glory from God the Father, such an utterance as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory, “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well-pleased”— **18** and we ourselves heard this utterance made from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.

>**19** So we have the prophetic word made more sure, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. **20 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, 21 for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.**
*2 Peter 1:16-21*

No matter how amazing the experience of seeing Jesus and the Father in their own glory , it is not more certain that the word of God, that experience will not give you greather faith nor give you greater confidence on who God is than what God has revealed in his Word. He said that is more certain than God's miracles. It is because God instructed the writers.

The words, “Thus saith the Lord” or “God said…” are found more than **1900** times in the Bible!

### 2. The Bible’s claims are supported:

- A. Internally
    - Fulfilled prophecy
        - Over 300 prophecies on the life of Jesus alone
        have been fulfilled in the New Testament.

    The chance of 8 out of 300 prophecies being fulfilled is 1 in 10 raised to the 45th power (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).

The chance of 8 out of 300 prophecies being fulfilled is 1 in 10 raised to the 45th power (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).

## Jesus' use of the Bible

But that the dead are raised, even Mosesshowed, in the passage about the burning bush,
where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. 38Now
He is not the God of the dead but of the living; for all live to Him.”

*Luke 20:37-38*

‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, Until I put Your enemies beneath Your feet”’? 45 If
David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?”

Matthew 22:44-45

- Internal consistency
    - Written over 1500 years in 3 languages…
    - By over 30 authors from different backgrounds…
    - In 2 different continents…

    Even news reports have different stories about particular events and happenings, but the Bible stays.
	
- B. External Evidence
	- Manuscript Evidence

    In this century alone, maraming physical evidences na nakuha, like the dead sea scrolls. It solidifies that what we read is almost exactly the original manuscript of the old times.

    - Earliest manuscripts (copies of the original) ofthe Bible written as early as 50 years after the original writings
    - About 50,000 manuscripts are still existing today.

    - the Bible has remained uncorrupted based on
    the existing original manuscripts we still have
    today

- Archaeology
    - Sodom and Gomorrah
        - Ebla tablets
    - The Bible is one of the best historical references for archaeologists
- Influence
    - The Bible is one of the best historical references
