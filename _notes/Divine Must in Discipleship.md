### Divine Must in Discipleship

#### Scripture

[[Mark]] 8:27-33

>**Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah**
27 Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
28 They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”
29 “But what about you?” he asked. “Who do you say I am?”
Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.”
30 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
**Jesus Predicts His Death**
31 He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. 32 He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
33 But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. “Get behind me, Satan!” he said. “You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”

#### Observation

>What observations can you make about the two contrasting rebukes in
verses 31 to 32 and verse 33?

Peter first rebuked Jesus, then Jesus rebuked Peter. Peter could not accept that Jesus had to suffer and go through so much pain. His thoughts about what a [[Messiah]]	is very different. We humans face this problem, we find it very hard to accept God's ways as it is very counter-intuitive and radical. 

However, look at the strength of the rebuke, "*Get behind me, Satan!*". There is very strong words here, signifying that pain and suffering was a **must.** 

As Pastor [[Edmund Chan]] says, 
>Our human thinking and worldly worldview can easily cause us to stumble over God’s truth and God’s ways.

Jesus also told Peter in v. 33 that *“You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”* The way we operate and the way God operates is very different.

#### Application

>What are the ways of God that I find difficult to accept and what changes do I need to make regarding that?

Right now, I find it extremely difficult to accept that God appointed [[Duterte]] as our President. The way our country is handling the pandemic is very unbelievable incompetent. But, Lord help me to understand your ways and to live out by divine necessity.
