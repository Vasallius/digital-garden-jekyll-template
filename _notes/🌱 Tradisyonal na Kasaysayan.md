- *Charles Victory Langlois* and *Charles Seignobos*
	- metodolohiyang tradisyunal
	- method was already used in Europe before
	- Book: *Introduction to the Study of History* first contained full elaboration of the methodology
- ### Characteristics of Traditional Method
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20358.png)
	- history only consists of past events
	- importance of documents in order to piece out what happened in history
	- criticism of authenticity of the document and its claims
	- places importance on rulers of society
- ‚ùì How can the historian verify stuff he did not see and experience by himself?
	- direct witnessing
	- indirect witnessing
		- analyzing remnants and remains of the events
		- forensic science
- ### Ang Tradisyunal na Batis: Ang Dokumentong Nakasulat
	- documents play an important role
		- no document = no history
	- #verify **heuristic technique**
	- ==problem: we are lacking in documents==
		- especially documents from sinaunang lipunang Pilipinos
		- kronika ng ibang bansa na nakipagkalakal sa atin
		- wala sa atin mismo
	- what's written in documents is not really the event itself, rather palatandaan ng sikolohiya at pag-iisip ng author
		- hindi pa tumpak na pagsasaksi
	- ==historians don't easily believe what they discover==
		- instead they question a lot of stuff
		- kritikang panlabas o kritika ng kapantasan
		- kritikang panloob o kritika ng kapaniwalaan
- #### Ang Kritikang Panlabas
	- **1. Restitusyon**
		- checking of document to return to its original state
		- error checking against main idea 
			- some are just "inserts" by other people
		- need to know the author, his works, and his style
		- cross check with other copies of documents
		- also need to know the language of the document
			- problem: foreign language (spanish and english)
	- **2. Pagtakda ng pinanggalingan**
		- date
			- often newer documents have dates
			- older documents don't
				- need to analyze handwriting, behavior of people, dress code, events, and word usage
		- place
			- where did the document come from?
			- determines social and political direction of the document
		- author
			- don't easily believe the author stated in the documents (he may not be the writer)
	- **3. Pag-uuri ng mga batis**
		- how did the author know of the events he wrote of?
		- if direct witnessing, we can use
		- if indirect witnessing, find the original source
			- if can't be found, use second batis
	- **just because document is authentic doesn't mean contents is true and right**
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20359.png)
- #### Ang Kritikang Panloob
	- checking the content
	- checking the conditions to which led to the creation of this document
	- Pagsuri ng nilalaman ng dokumento
		- *interpretative criticism*
		- **STEP 1: **Pagsusuri ng nilalaman ng dokumento
			- however, literal meanings chance
			- ==literal interpretations need to be reinforced with historial interpretations==
		- **4 Principles**
			- meaning of words evolve
				- know the meaning of word in that context and situation
			- language has different importance/meaning in different places
			- different authors have different styles
			- expressions also change, need to read it with the main idea in mind
		- to know the true meaning
		- #verify **hermeneutic technique**
		- **STEP 2: **Pagtakda ng katiyakan ng pag-uulat
			- analyze the environment
			- need to know the author's beliefs
			- need to know if author truly witnessed the event
			- shows the authenticity and katumpkan ng saksi
			- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20360.png)
			- **common reasons to not be faithful to writing**
				- **Reason 1**
				- author wants to benefit from their writing
				- coerce the reader to do or not do something
				- almost all official documents
				- reasons to lie:
					- personal interest
					- collective interest
					- ==need to know where the author stands==
				- **Reason 2**
				- put into situations where author has to lie
				- often when documents must adhere to the normal or the mandated rules
				- **Reason 3**
				- author has sympathy or anti-sympathy towards a group of people, institution or ideology
				- **Reason 4**
				- forced to lie for self-glorification
				- needs to be doubted or questioned
				- **Reason 5**
				- either give happiness to public or avoid panic and shock
				- depends on the morality of the public
				- **Reason 6**
				- flowery words
				- will add vivid and colorful details
				- will insert dakilang gawain, adhikain, o pananalita ang mga taong isusulat niya
		- **not at all times can we determine the author**
		- can the historian use a document with an unnamed author?
			- compare to similar writings or groups
		- how will you analyze this?
		- only fraction of events, how does this fit the bigger picture?
- ### Ang Pamamaraan ng Pagbubuo ng Kasaysayan
	- **4 WAYS**
	- **1. Paghahambing sa Kasalukuyan**
		- compare to present events
		- notice the similarities and differences
		- historian must be knowledgeable about current events
	- **2. Pag-uuri ng Kaganapan**
		- **4 URI**
		- ayon sa panlabas na kalagayan
			- isang panahon
			- isang bansa
			- isang tao
		- ayon sa panloob na kalagayan
			- sining
			- relihiyon
			- panitikan
		- ayon sa isang grupong taglay ang iisang katangian
			- know the group and its beliefs
			- where do they differ and where do they agree
		- ayon sa panahon
			- will be able to determine start and end of panahon if we know what chnaged the behaviors of the people
	- need to study about events in that civilization
		- institution
		- behavior
		- idea
		- politics
	- most events come from people in power
		- two ways to know if the person was influential enough

		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20362.png)
	- **3. 	Paggamit ng Pangangatwiran**
		- since not all documents and not all events are recorded, reason is necessary
		- **Ang Negatibong pangangatwiran**
			- reason from lack of evidence
			- if event was not mentioned in other documents, it didn't happen
			- ==absence of evidence isn't evidence for absence==
				- secret stuff of government
				- events concerning maltreatment of poor people
			- **two usapin**
				- if an event is not mentioned, there is an interested to gather all data first
				- an event must be very influential that it can't be hidden to the public
		- **Ang Positibong Pangangatwiran**
			- starts with an event proved by an authentic method
			- find truths that that document did not mention
	- **4. Ang Paglalahad ng Pangkalahatang Pormula**
		- form a formula and attach all events
		- **Three Formulas**
			- destiny / meant to be / willed by God
				- everything starts ane ends with GOd
			- rational and everything fits a whole plan

- ### Panumbalik
	- history is about analyzing the documents written
	- documents must not be lost or broken
	- documents are needed to show the real events
	- history explains how our present came to be
	- history enriches thinking
	- doing criticism is good for the brain and makes us sharp
	- we'll be able to differentiate the civilization and people
	- shows change; we should not be afraid of change
