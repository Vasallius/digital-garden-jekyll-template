## Getting the Most out of Small Habits
## Setting Yourself up For Success, the Easy Way
## Channeling Your Inner Productive Fiend

Have you ever wondered why successful people are successful ? Probably yes, and I'm pretty sure that you want to be successful as well. 

We all know that success isn't really gonna happen overnight. It's a process. A process of repetitive habits that lead to remarkable results. Today we explore Atomic Habits by James Clear.

### What are atomic habits?
Atomic habits are the **building blocks of remarkable results** just as how atoms make up about generally everything. 

It is something that you do day in and day out that set you up to success. 

You may be thinking of really flashy or difficult tasks but in reality they're pretty simple habits that when compounded produce great results.

### Compounding
Habits that seem trivial and unimportant will compound into something great if we are willing to keep on doing them for weeks, months, and years to come. It's because the effects of our habits multiply and increase proportionally to the number of repetitions.

This figure shows that being 1 percent better everyday for a year, actually makes you **37% better** after one year. Who wouldn't want to be a better person amirite?

But being impatient humans as we all are, we expect quick results and massive changes just because we're doing something better. We stop and get disappointed when we don't see the results that we want.

The **Plateau of Latent Potenia**l demonstrates this. We fail to realize that results from compounding are not linear but rather they are exponential in nature. They may be **unnoticeable at first but eventually they yield wondrous results**.

### Systems vs Goals

James Clear tells us that we must **forget goals** as they do not matter; we are to simply **focus on building our systems** instead. 

We spend a ridiculous amount of time thinking about our goals when that time can be better spent building a system that would allow us to reach our goals easier.

He summarizes some problems that lies with focusing on goals.
1. Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

It is clear that goals do not make winners win.

2. Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

What comes after achieving your goal? Maybe a quick burst of dopamine and nothing more.

3. Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.

It's either you achieve a goal and be successful or fail and feel like a disappointment. The latter is more probable if you don't have a good system.

4. Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

James Clear best said it here.
>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. Itâ€™s not about any single accomplishment.

So we know that the root problem of having a hard time to change our habits is our system. We can't change bad habits because our system is conducive for bad habits to continue being bad.

>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

### Behavior Change

![[Pasted image 248.png]]

As you'll see there are three layers as presented by James Clear. 

The common approach is that we base our habits on outcomes instead of our identity.

You see, there is a problem with this. Your old identity will most likely hinder your new plans of change.

**When we change our identity, our habits change.**

The goal is to not just read a book but to build our identity as a reader. The goal is not to just learn to play an instrument but to build our identity as a musician or someone who makes music.

Think of it like a domino effect.

**Poor identity leads to poor processes that eventually produces poor outcomes.**

Progress requires unlearning and revision of our identity.

### Building a Habit
Now let's talk about how to actually build a habit and continue to do that new habit. 

This section is divided into four parts: **cue**, **craving**, **response**, and **reward**.

#### Cue

Cue is what triggers our brains to do something. It's the cause of our actions.

Ever wondered why we se say something needs to be done but we never seem to make time for it and instead procrastinate?

Well, maybe our brains aren't receiving triggers to do these stuff.

**The first law is to make stuff that you want do obvious.**

When things are obvious, it's a lot easier to notice them and our brain can pick up this trigger and actually act upon it.

One of the ways we can do this is by **desgining our environment in such a way that it becomes a breeding place for habits to grow and flourish**. Environment is one of the the things that unconciously shape our behavior.

Flossing wasn't a habit for me but brushing my teeth was. By putting the floss near the toothbrushes, i was seeing it now more often and the brain would be cued to make me floss.

For bad habits, we just have to invert it. Instead of making it obvious, **we make it invisible.**

If your phone or mobile gadget is out of sight, you would not be compelled to use it and endlessly scroll through instagram or facebook.

#### Craving

Craving is the motivational force behind every habit.

**The second law is to make it attractive.**

It being attractive increases the chance of the habit happening.

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. If you enjoy doing something you'll probably do it again and again. It eventually becomes a habit.

Sometimes we may encounter stuff that we want to do but they don't seem to be attractive. The trick there is to **reframe our perspective**

We can reframe the way we look at habits by **highlighting their benefits** rather than their drawbacks. I mean if it's a good habit for sure there are benefits right?

Another way to make it attractive is to **join a culture** where that kind of habit is celebrated.

You'd be more likely to read if you're in a book-readers club. You're more likely to study hard if you're friends take pride in studying hard.

**Surround yourself with people that share the habits you want to develop.**

And similar to the first one we can get rid of bad habits by inverting the second law.

**Make it unattractive.**

By **highlighting the bad stuff** of the habit, you are more likely to stop doing it. 

In my case I stopped playing games because it made me realize that I'm grinding for ranks that no one really cared about. 

After pouring hours upon hours of grinding, what did I get? Temporary happiness and sleep deprivation. 

Gaming now to me feels like a **time-waste**.

#### Response

Response is the actual habit we do.

**The third law is to make it easy**.

We humans are very lazy in nature and given two tasks, we would to the one that takes fewer effort to do.

For me journalling wasn't something I initially liked. I found it very hard to flesh out words on the paper. But that all changed.

Instead of requiring myself to write tons of words, I just required myself to write a **single sentence a day**. This was **very easy**.

Anyone can literally do it.

This habit eventually grew as I scaled it to 2 sentences, then later to a paragraph, and eventually to a page.

This was all possible because I **valued progress over perfection**.

Voltaire once wrote, "Perfect is the enemy of the good."

If i required myself to always have a well fleshed out journal then I probably would not have made it into a habit.

If you can't even start, then you don't have a chance of making it a habit. **Start small and be consistent then scale it.**

And similar to the first one we can get rid of bad habits by inverting the second law.

**Make it difficult.**

By increasing the friction of those habits, you are more likely to be lazy to do it. 

Maybe you find our self watching TV too often. What you can do is to remove the batteries after you watch and place the remote in someplace that is not accessible. Surely, you'll barely find time to watch TV because it's so difficult.

#### Reward

Rewards are the end goals of our habits.

**The 4th law is to make it satisfying**

We our likely to repeat behaviors that give us satisfying experiences. But our habits often deliver **delayed gratification**.

It is the less-traveled road. But the road that leads to success.

I mean if you want to be successful, you must be willing to put off temporary pleasures and gratification.

But the question is how do we stay on that road? How do we become consistent?

One practical way is to use a **habit-tracker** whether it be manually listing it or using an app like Habitica.

It's pleasing to see as you make progress on your habits, this makes it satisfying and fuels your dopamine.

Don't break the chain is a powerful motivation to keep on doing your habits. Becareful of missing once though. Missing twice is a start of a new habit. **So never miss twice**.

Another proven way to be consistent is to have an **accountability partner**. Someone who will keep you in check and hold you accountable.

You can even devise a contract and get punished when you don't do something. The more costly the punishment is the more likely you won't do it again. Such is the fourth law.

**Make it unsatisfying.**

### How to Stay Motivated

In pyschology there is the Yerkes-Dodson law or the Goldilocks rule. The figure below describes it really well.

![[Pasted image 254.png]]

There is a sweet spot between difficulty (approximately 4% beyond your current ability) where-in we can reach the flow state.

Being in the flow is like being in the zone, being fully immersed in an activity. Being is this state allows for more breakthroughs and more work done.

Lastly, you'd probably get bored along the path to success because  you keep on doing the same habits. As James Clear says At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self- improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

Becoming an athlete that only performs well during fair-weather or prime conditions is not a good athlete. A good athlete performs well no matter the situation.

Like them we want to be able to do the stuff we need to do whether it be times of inspiration or times of drought.

### Conclusion
Cultivating habits is like cultivating a plant or a tree. As you water it everyday it increases in size and eventually grow into a gigantic tree.

The secret to success it to never stop making improvements. Fall in love with boredom and stick with your habits as they compound into something greater.

Don't get caught up in the fact that we have limits, but rather let's exert the effort required to get close to them and eventually surpass them.

Develop a repertoire of atomic habits. Set yourself up to success.
