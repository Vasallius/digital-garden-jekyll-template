### What Kind of Messiah

#### Scripture

[[Mark]] 8:27-31

>**Peter’s Declaration about Jesus**
27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
28 “Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”
29 Then he asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.”
30 But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
**Jesus Predicts His Death**
31 Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but three days later he would rise from the dead.

#### Observation

>What is the significance of “Jesus began to teach” His disciples about
His suffering, rejection, death and resurrection after their confession,
“You are the Messiah” (v.31)?

The disciples thought that the [[Messiah]] is someone who's gonna conquer and dominate the world, but Jesus told them differently. Jesus had to experience pain and suffering and to die. But, in three days he would rise again, and that's what differentiates Him from other gods of this secular world. In order to triumph, he had to go through suffering, very counter-intuitive indeed.

#### Application

>How do I live through the world’s evil domination over the people of God?

Well, like Jesus, I must be able to be willing to suffer, because I know that in the end it's gonna be worth it. Jesus has suffered greatly for us, it's time we suffer for Him, for the advancement of the [[Gospel]].

#### Prayer

Lord, thank you for waking me up and giving me yet another day of living. Thank you also that you have allowed me to sustain my devotions day after day. Lord, I pray for the church leaders, from the elders, council of servants, pastors, drgoup leaders, and all leadership positions in CCF, I pray that you give them wisdom and knowledge always. Lord, I really pray that the younger generation gets to know You deeply and be anchored in Your Word alone. Lord, I pray for the people who lack the financial capabilities to sustain themselves, Lord you are the great provider, I ask that you provide for them. Lord, I pray for myself and my sinful tendencies. Help me again to get rid of those. Lord, I also pray for a macbook pro, if it is Your will, give it to me.
