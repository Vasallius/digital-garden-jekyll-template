Learning on your own helps you grapple the material which reinforces understanding. You will be able to understand more deeply the concepts being taught. A lot of the great inventors and scientists came from a background that wasn't really of the maths and science. But, they were able to succeed through persistence. Something to avoid is the mentality of teacher-centered learning wherein the teacher holds all the answers and the knowledge about the topic. Student-centered learning allows you to freely explore the topic and find gaps and resolve confusing stuff.
