### Questions on the Way

#### Scripture
Mark 8:27-30

>Peter’s Declaration about Jesus
27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
28 “Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”
29 Then he asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.”
30 But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.

Why did Jesus tell people not to tell anyone about Him?

#### Observation

>What is the significance of “Christ” being mentioned the first time in the narrative proper of Mark’s Gospel in the present context?

Before, the disciples did not really know Jesus. In [[Mark 4]], when they were faced with the storm, they were overwhelmed that the wind and waves obeyed Jesus and they asked each other, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" But now, Peter answers that he is the [[Messiah]].

#### Application

>In what ways have I or have I not been growing in knowing Jesus deeper over time?

At this moment, I have been growing in knowing Jesus as I am doing devotions everyday. I also have an interest in [[Apologetics]]. Sometimes, there is that intense desire to know Jesus and defend the faith and sometimes I just want to chill and experience Him for myself.

#### Prayer	

Lord, I pray for restoration of harmony in the house. I also pray for my spiritual growth and maturity, help me seek you more Lord. I also pray for the leaders and elders of CCF and all its satelites.
