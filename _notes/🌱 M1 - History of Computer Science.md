Alan Turing created the universal computing machine. It was essentially a machine that can compute anything computable. This led to the development of what we now call modern computer.

Alan Turing also played a vital part in the war against Germany. He broke the infamously difficult enigma code that had around 159 million million million ways to be set. The code-breaking machine he built was called The Bomb. This ruled out all the wrong settings.
	
His ground-breaking idea that anything can be represented by numbers and these numbers will be fed to the processor to tell the computer what to do.
