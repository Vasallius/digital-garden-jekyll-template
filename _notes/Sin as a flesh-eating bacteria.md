Similar to how that flesh-eating bacteria that harmed Aimee, sin is something just like that. When we allow sin to continously take over our life, our life will be ruined. We may have to figuratively amputate some of our body parts, but there is a way to overcome sin. This way is Jesus. When we fully surrender our lives to Him and make it a conscious choice not to sin, we decrease the chances of Satan laying a stronghold in our lives.

>After a zip-lining accident in 2012, I was hospitalized and diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis – a flesh-eating, bacterial infection. While the doctors worked hard to save my life, they had to amputate both of my hands, my right foot and my entire left leg. I was 24 years old and grateful that I survived – but the road to recovery that lay before me felt overwhelming.
