### Authentic Discipleship
speaker: [[Dan Carandang]]

the cost is high

you're gonna waste time opportunity

"What is your vision? What is your understanding of what we’re called to do in the campus?"

Nehro blamed the christian community for the fire caused

in times of great stress and trials and persecution and hardship-it is during these times athat the reality of our faith is seen

Just like what God said through Paul to Timothy, His Word for you is: “Keep doing what I’ve called you to do; keep reaching the lost and engaging the lost and making disciples.”

"Being strong is in the passive tense in this passage: this strength is not from us, we can’t produce it—rather, we allow God to strengthen us with it."
 
>"if we want to be able to do what God has called us to do, if we want to be able to be faithful in doing it—no matter what happens around us, we need to allow God to strengthen us with His grace."

Where are you getting the strength of making disciples ❓

Even the best disciple will hurt you and disappoint you.

If hype is the primary reason, then you're gonna burn out because the hype will fade.

we're using discipleship to fill that void of signifance of value
but only God can fill that void

we don't read the bible just for the sake of reading; we don't pray just for the sake of reading

if we are spiritually burnout, it's our fault

it wasn't leader-centered, they were to empower others
leadership development, multiplying the leaders, the passing on

are these things present in your campus movement?

'just because you have a meeting, doesn't mean you are a movement"

superficial meeting, not a movement

john 4:35

**be empowered by God's grace and go and make disciples**
