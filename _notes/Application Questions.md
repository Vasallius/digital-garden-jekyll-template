These questions enable members to actually take whatever they learned be it an idea or a principle and actually apply it to their day to day life. Because after all, what is knowledge that is not applied? It rots in our brain, not used, rendered useless.

Example questions are:
>What changes will you make this week as a result of our discussion on the creation story?
What one spiritual discipline will you commit to this month? When will you practice this discipline?
