## Verse of the Day

> 2 Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart.
*Colossians 4:2 NLT*

I've been slacking of my prayer time recently, but this verse reminds me to **devote** myself to prayer. Prayer is a something that serves as communication to our God. If we do not communicate with Him, how then can we know His plans for us? Through prayer can we also explicitly express our gratitude, that otherwise we forget.

> 23 For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was **betrayed**, the Lord Jesus took some bread 24 and **gave thanks** to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant between God and his people—an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this in remembrance of me as often as you drink it.” 26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are **announcing the Lord’s death** until he comes again.
1 Corinthians 11:23-26

> 26 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take this and eat it, for this is my body.”
27 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, “Each of you drink from it, 28 for this is my blood, which confirms the **covenant** between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many.
*Matthew 26:26-28*

The Lord's Supper reminds us of how Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for the sins of many, to pay for something he **did not** commit. How great and awesome is that? But we human beings, because of the business of day to day life, we sometimes forget things Jesus has done. Jesus knew this. He knew that we will forget Him, that's why he instructed the church to continuously do Lord's supper in remembrance of Him. I pray that we take Jesus' sacrifice on the cross seriously. We have been given a life we did not earn. Let us cherish it and do things of eternal value.
