### Review
>What was my high point and my low point for the week?

I can easily say that the low points are the chaos in the family and dispute with dad. He has been very prideful and immature for an adult, I find it hard to stand Him. This is has left me annoyed and angry, why would a Christian adult be like that?

I guess my high point is growth group. Facilitating the group was such a delight, I got to explain faith more clearly. Watching dramas were also a high point. Also, ELEVATE UNITE 2020 happened yesterday, it was so amazing. I was crying listening to their new song, *Conquering Love*. I got to invite some friends, namely, Angela, Caitlyn, Adrienne, Christine. I'm glad they were able to come. Adrienne wants to go back to God, and I will be helping Him.

>What gave me life and what drained me?

I think by immersing more into God's word and continuously having devotion and praise and worship gave me more ilfe. I guess very draining is preparing for growth group, haha, I have so much to do.

>How was the Spirit of God at work?

Related to the UNITE 2020, I think God touched Adrienne's heart to go back to Christianity. He was eager to learn more and even started a reading plan with me.

### Reflect

>What is one key thing that God said to me this week
in light of what has happened?

I don't really remember.

### Respond

>What is one thing I need to do in light of what God
is saying? Commit in prayer.

Family harmony.
