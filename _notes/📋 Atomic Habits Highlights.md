Atomic Habits
Introduction: My Story

We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: **changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remark	able results if you’re willing to stick with them for years**. **We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.**

What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “**the aggregation of marginal gains**,” which was the philosophy of searching for a **tiny margin of improvement** in everything you do.

FIGURE 1: The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.

Page 20

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the **effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them**.

Page 20

**Success is the product of daily habits**—not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.

Page 21

Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.

Page 21

In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a **Valley of Disappointment.**

Page 23

But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the **Plateau of Latent Potential**.
![[Pasted image 247.png]]

Page 24

Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.

Page 24

The task of breaking a bad habit is like **uprooting a powerful oak** within us. And the task of building a good habit is like **cultivating a delicate flower** one day at a time.

**FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD**

Page 25

Page 25

A handful of problems arise when you **spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems**.

Page 27

**Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.**

Page 27

**Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.**
Page 27

**Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.**
Page 28

Furthermore, **goals create an “either-or” conflict**: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.

Page 28

**Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.**
Page 28

When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, **what is left to push you forward after you achieve it?**

Page 28

The purpose of **setting goals is to win the game**. The **purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game**. **True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment**. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

Page 28

**If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.**

Page 29

**You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.**

Page 29

Chapter Summary

Page 29

Habits are the **compound interest of self-improvement**. Getting **1 percent better every day** counts for a lot in the long-run.

Page 29

Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.

Page 29

**Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.** The **most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed**. You need to be patient.

Page 29

An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, **atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.**

Page 29

If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

Page 30

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

**THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE**
![[Pasted image 248.png]]

Page 31

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to **outcome-based habits**. The alternative is to build 
**identity-based habits**. With this approach, we start by **focusing on who we wish to become**.

Page 32

They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their **old identity can sabotage their new plans for change**.

Page 34

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

Page 34

**The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity.**

Page 35

True behavior change is identity change.

Page 35

**The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.**

Page 35

Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

Page 36

**Progress requires unlearning.**

Page 36

This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. **We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self**.

Page 38

The **formation of all habits is a feedback loop** (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results.

Page 40

Identity change is the North Star of habit change.

Page 40

There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.

Page 41

The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.

Page 41

Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Page 41

Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

Page 41

The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Page 41
THE FUNDAMENTALS: Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

**From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.”**

Page 43

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

Page 43

Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.

Page 44

As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

Page 44

**Your brain skips the process of trial and error and creates a mental rule: if this, then that.**

Page 44

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: **cue, craving, response, and reward**.* Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.

Page 45

First, there is the cue. **The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.**

Page 46

Cravings are the second step, and they are the **motivational force behind every habit**.

Page 46

Without some level of motivation or desire— without craving a change—we have no reason to act.

Page 46

What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides.

Page 46

You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later…

Page 46

The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.

Page 46

If a particular action requires more physical or mental effort than you are willing to expend, then you won’t do it.

Page 46

**Rewards are the end goal of every habit.**

Page 47

Finally, the response delivers a reward.

Page 47

**The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward.**

Page 47

We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

Page 47

Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive. Getting a promotion brings more money and respect. Getting in shape improves your health and your dating prospects. But the more immediate benefit is that rewards satisfy your craving to eat or to gain status or to win approval. At least for a moment, rewards deliver contentment and relief from craving.

Page 47

The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving.

Page 47

Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

Page 47

FIGURE 6: The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*

Page 48

I refer to this framework as the Four Laws of Behavior Change, and it provides a simple set of rules for creating good habits and breaking bad ones.

Page 51

**How to Create a Good Habit**

Page 51

**The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying**.

**Inversion of the 1st law (Cue): Make it invisible. Inversion of the 2nd law (Craving): Make it unattractive. Inversion of the 3rd law (Response): Make it difficult. Inversion of the 4th law (Reward): Make it unsatisfying.**

**Why do I say something is important but never seem to make time for it?**

Page 52
**THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious** - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

THE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father- in-law and got very concerned. “I don’t like the way you look,” she said. Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied, “Well, I don’t like your looks, either.” “No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.” A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in- law’s intuition, he could have died. What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart attack? When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face. After many years of working with people with heart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something was wrong.

Page 54

Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts can identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and

Page 54

which one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are traveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly like the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but even his superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.

Page 55

Museum curators have been known to discern the difference between an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.

Page 55

Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye.

Page 55

I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.

Page 55

**The human brain is a prediction machine.**

Page 55

For this reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.

Page 56

**As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”**

Page 57

As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.*

Page 57

This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes.

Page 57

The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last.

Page 58

**The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them.**

Page 60
THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit

I N 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into three groups. The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how often they exercised. The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve heart health. Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.

Page 62

The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an **implementation intention**, which is a plan you make beforehand about

Page 62

That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.

Page 63

Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy appointment.

Page 63

The punch line is clear: **people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through**. Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out.

Page 63

**Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.**

Page 63

It is not always obvious when and where to take action.

Page 63

As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”

Page 64

In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the **Diderot Effect**.

Page 65

Many human behaviors follow this cycle. **You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing**. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry

Page 65

detergent to the shopping list, and so on.** No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.**

Page 66

Why is this important?

Page 66

**When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage.**

Page 66

One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called **habit stacking**.

Page 66

Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.*

Page 66

The habit stacking formula is:

Page 66

**“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”**

Page 66

FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue for the next.

Page 67

**The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious**. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action.

Page 70
THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious - 6: **Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More**

Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More

Page 72

**People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are.**

Page 73

**Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.**
Page 73

In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E).

Page 73

It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them.

Page 74

The truth, however, is that **many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option**.

Page 74

**If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment.**

Page 76

**If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable.**

Page 79

A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.

**It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.**

Page 79
THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious - 7: The Secret to Self-Control

Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self- control. In other words, **they spend less time in tempting situations**.

Page 82

The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. **It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often**. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.

Page 82

**Bad habits are autocatalytic**: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.

Page 83

**Self-control is a short-term strategy**, not a long-term one. You may be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to override your desires every time.

Page 84

**Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.** This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.

**One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to
reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.**

Page 84
THE 2ND LAW: **Make It Attractive** - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible

I N THE 1940S, a Dutch scientist named Niko Tinbergen performed a series of experiments that transformed our understanding of what motivates us. Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often seen flying along the seashores of North America. Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot whenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered these dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether. However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had been genetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he created a beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went crazy with delight. They pecked at the little red patches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen. Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird. Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the goose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it back into the nest.

Page 87

Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try to get it. It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.

Page 88

**If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive.**

Page 90

Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst.

Page 90

In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine- releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without desire, action stopped. When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so

Page 90

different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times per hour.)

Page 91

**Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop.**

Page 91

**It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action.
**

Desire is the engine that drives behavior.

Page 93

Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

Page 93

This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling comes into play.

Page 93

He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit more attractive. **Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do.**

Page 93

Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as **Premack’s Principle**.

Page 94

Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.”

THE 2ND LAW: Make It Attractive - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

I N 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of strange letters to a woman named Klara. Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with deliberate practice and the development of good habits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.” Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a wife willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she may not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper instruction, anyone could advance their skills. Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess. Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit. Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old. Within six months, she was defeating adults.

Page 97

Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster. Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time— younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty- seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player in the world.

1. Imitating the Close

Page 99

Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior.

Page 99

Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for natural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us.

Page 100

**One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.**

Page 100

The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.

Page 101

This is why remaining part of a group after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.

Page 101

2. Imitating the Many

Page 101

Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room with the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the group answer even though it was obviously incorrect.

Page 103

**Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.**

Page 103

The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it— you can choose to ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work. Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.

Page 103

**When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive.**

Page 103

Imitating the Powerful

Page 104

This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective people.

Page 104

The Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of this chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social influences can have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for many hours each day and continued this remarkable effort for decades. But these habits and behaviors maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their culture. From the praise of their

Page 104

parents to the achievement of different status markers like becoming a grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their effort.

Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.

Page 109

**Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.**

Page 110

You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.

Page 111

I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.

Page 111

**Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.**

Page 111

Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”

Page 111

Finance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.

Page 111

Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction inevitably pops into your mind. You can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath. Distraction is a good thing because you need distractions to practice meditation.

Page 111

Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with

Page 111

fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”

Page 112

If you want to take it a step further, you can create a **motivation ritual**.

Page 112

Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally.

Page 112

You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy— like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile.

Page 112

Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.

Page 112

Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and

Page 112

smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation. **The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them.** It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.

**Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem
unattractive.**

THE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward

O N THE FIRST day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida, divided his film photography students into two groups. Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a B, eighty photos a C, and so on. Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality” group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be a nearly perfect image. At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.*

Page 116

It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. **We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action…**

Page 116

**As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”**

Page 116

I refer to this as the **difference between being in motion and taking action**. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. **When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning.** Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result.

Page 117

**Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome**. If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s action.

Page 117

**Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done.**

Page 117

**When preparation becomes a form of procrastination**, you need to change something. **You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing.**

Page 117

**If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.** You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in.

Page 117

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.

Page 118

**Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation**, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.

Page 118
![[Pasted image 250.png]]
Page 119

**There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days.**

**The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as
important as the number of times you have performed it.**

Page 120
THE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy - 12: The Law of Least Effort

**Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb one.**


Page 124

Every action requires a certain amount of energy. **The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.**

Page 124

I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The Japanese companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)

Page 126

**The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.** Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to** reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.**

Page 127

If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell a friend or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a coworker to keep it at their desk in the morning and give it back to you at lunch.

Page 129

Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?”** Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.**

**Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally
gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of
work.**

THE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

WYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and choreographers of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, often referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has spent the bulk of her career touring the globe to perform her original works. She also credits much of her success to simple daily habits. “I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30 A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my hat. I walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First Avenue, where I work out for two hours. “The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver where to go I have completed the ritual. “It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it—makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it differently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to think about.”

Page 131

**Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit.**

Page 131

**Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.**

Page 132

Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior.

Page 132

I refer to these little choices as **decisive moments.**

Page 132

We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout your day is so important.

Page 133
Figure
Page 133

Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.

Page 134

**THE TWO-MINUTE RULE**

Page 134

**“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two
minutes to do.”
**
**If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details.**

Page 135

The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know that the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like you’re trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do one push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a mental trick, why would you fall for it?

Page 135
Table
Page 135

One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, “Well, I’m always coming here anyway. I might as well start staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.

Page 136

Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore.* The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.

Page 136

Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row —even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the type of person you want to be. **We rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the end goal…**

Page 136

But one push-up is better than not exercising. **One minute of guitar practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.**

Page 136

At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the **Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal.** Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level. Eventually, you’ll end up with



Page 136

the habit you had originally hoped to build while still keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the behavior.

**Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.**

THE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy - 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

I N THE SUMMER OF 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831. Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.*

Page 139

A **commitment device** is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.*

Page 139

**Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the future by making bad habits difficult in the present**
However, we can do even better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.

John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.

Page 140

It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money.

Page 141

The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.

Page 141

Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.

THE 4TH LAW: Make It Satisfying - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change

“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The marketing team at Procter & Gamble talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.”

Page 148

**We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.**

Page 149

Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: **What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.**

Page 149

You live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.

Page 150

You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.

Page 150

**Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels goo…**

Page 151

The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . **Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”**

**The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification.**

Page 152

**At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.**

Page 152

**Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.**

THE 4TH LAW: Make It Satisfying - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

N 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit. Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.

Page 156

I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years, I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways.

Page 156

**But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.**

Page 157

**“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra.**

Page 157

**Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.**

Page 157

**Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.**

Page 158

In** summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.**

Page 159

No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your family needs a little more of your time. Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: **never miss twice.**

Page 160

**The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.**

Page 161

This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we optimize for what we measure. **When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.**

Page 162

Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, **“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”**

**One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making
progress.**

THE 4TH LAW: Make It Satisfying - 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

A FTER SERVING AS a pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended Harvard Law School and spent thirty-four years specializing in negotiation and conflict management. He founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and world leaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic compromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most interesting idea.

Page 165

At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could prevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting president would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would never actually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of miles away. “My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.

Page 165

“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.’”

Page 166

**If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored.**

Page 166

**Pain is an effective teacher.**

Page 166

There is, of course, a limit to this. If you’re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then **the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct**.

Page 166

Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit: **create a habit contract.**

Page 167

A habit contract is a **verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through.**

Page 167

You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”

Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle- distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.

**In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.**

Page 182

N 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece. Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming a comedian.

Page 182

Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty club.

Page 182

It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems during the show just to make the routine long enough, but his skills continued to progress. He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing.

Page 182

He took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land

Page 182

his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being a regular guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.

Page 183

Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in New York. He catapulted to the top of his genre and became one of the most successful comedians of his time.

Page 183

This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the **Goldilocks Rule**.

And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a **flow state**.*

Page 185

A flow state is the experience of **being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an activity**. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve a state of flow, **a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current abilit**y. In real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability— seems crucial for maintaining motivation.

“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?” He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: **“At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”**

Page 185

**But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes.**

Page 186

All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much.

**The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.**

As Machiavelli noted, “**Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”**

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines are the most common real-world example.

**At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self- improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.**
Page 187

**But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.**

David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, y**ou don’t want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair- weather anything.**

**The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.**

ADVANCED TACTICS: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great - 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits

The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.

Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery

After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.”

ADVANCED TACTICS: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great - Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last

T HERE IS AN ancient Greek parable known as the **Sorites Paradox**,* which talks about the effect one small action can have when repeated enough times.

Page 199

One formulation of the paradox goes as follows: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim that he or she is rich. But what if you add another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that no one can be rich unless one coin can make him or her so. We can say the same about atomic habits. Can one tiny change transform your life? It’s unlikely you would say so. But what if you made another? And another? And another? At some point, you will have to admit that your life was transformed by one small change.

**The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements**.
It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t

stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop learning. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop saving. It’s remarkable the friendships you can build if you don’t stop caring. Small habits don’t add up. They compound.

Page 201

That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.

Appendix - Little Lessons from the Four Laws

Awareness comes before desire.

Page 204

Happiness is simply the absence of desire.

Page 204

It is the idea of pleasure that we chase.

Page 205

Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event.

Page 205

**With a big enough why you can overcome any how.**

Page 205

Being curious is better than being smart.

Page 205

**As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”**

Page 205

Emotions drive behavior.

Page 205

We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.

Page 206

Your response tends to follow your emotions.

Page 206

Suffering drives progress.

Page 206

**Your actions reveal how badly you want something.**

Page 206

Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.

Page 207

Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.

Page 207

Our expectations determine our satisfaction.

Page 207

The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.

Page 208

Feelings come both before and after the behavior.

**Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.**

Page 208

Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance. The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be.
