### Giving Our All to God I

#### Scripture

[[Matthew]] 15:29-39
>**Jesus Heals Many People**
29 Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down. 30 A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn’t speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and he healed them all. 31 The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn’t been able to speak were talking, the crippled were made well, the lame were walking, and the blind could see again! And they praised the God of Israel.
**Jesus Feeds Four Thousand**
32 Then Jesus called his disciples and told them, “I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry, or they will faint along the way.”
33 The disciples replied, “Where would we get enough food here in the wilderness for such a huge crowd?”
34 Jesus asked, “How much bread do you have?”
They replied, “Seven loaves, and a few small fish.”
35 So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. 36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to the disciples, who distributed the food to the crowd.
37 They all ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food. 38 There were 4,000 men who were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children. 39 Then Jesus sent the people home, and he got into a boat and crossed over to the region of Magadan.

#### Observation

> ❓ What do you observe about the disciples’ response (v.33)?

I think there's doubt and unbelief again from the disciples. They might be panicking on how to provide for the people. However, they've seen Jesus feed many people before, so what's the difference now? These disciples did not have the same moving compassion Jesus had for these Gentiles. It was a heart problem. The thing that we can learn here is that when there is a greet need, let us open our hearts to this need.

#### Application

> ❓ What is hindering me from having a heart of compassion?

Right now, what is hindering me is the lack of money and engagement. However, compassion is not mutually exclusive with these two things. As such, I must still show compassion by praying for these people and actually helping those who need help.

#### Prayer

Lord, help me have a compassion heart. Help me to care for the people you care about. Lord, thank you for waking me up another day, praises and glory are Yours alone. Lord, I also pray for strength and energy as I tackle my day today. I also pray for Adrienne's family to have harmony.
