	- >A machine does not create any new information, but it performs very valuable transformation of known information. 
	> *Leonard Brillouin*

- **p. 150 What is information?**
	- in ordinary language, something we have not yet known
	- notion: information decreases uncertainty
	- information is relative to the size of the 'alphabet'
	
- **p . 152 Syntactic and semantic information**
	- *syntactic information* - received information but meaning can't be deciphered
		- still information, since you know what the message is, something you did not know before
	- related to : *Shannon Theory of Information*
	- *semantic information* - message has meaning to you
	- meaning of the message cannot be determined without prior knowledge of the context
		- 'YES' is my answer, but to what question?
	- **more information is required to interpret information**

- **p. 154 DNA and information**

- **p. 155 Complexity and Algorithmic information theory**
	- *algorithm* - mechanical process of repetition
	- *algorithmically incompressible* - length of the algorithm would be more likely as long as the length of the string itself
		- cannot arise from simple algorithmic processes as an *emergent property*
	- random monkey typing vs first 6 billion letters of English books
		- equally *random and incompressible*
		- both very complex for different reasons
			- semantic and syntactic
	- ![[Pasted image 318.png]]
	- the A C G T is mathematically random as they are algorithmically incompressible
	- proteins exhibit as high degree of molectular sensitivity in a sense that even a substitution of a single amino acid and result to catatrophic failure
	- *specfied complexity*
	- ![[Pasted image 319.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 320.png]]
	- mathematics students won't keep proving a conjecture again without an alternative
	- people won't take perpetual notion machines seriously
	- if we say an organized sequence on Mars let's say 1 3 5 7 9 11, we would have assumed there was input from intelligent design but why is it when we discover DNA, something very complex, we infer that it came from chance and necessity
- **p. 162 Is information conserved?**
	- molecular machines like protein and flagella only transform existing information, not create it
	- Peter Medawar
		- "No process of logical reasoning - no mere act of mind or computer-programmable operation - can enlarge the information content of the axioms and premises or observation statements from which it proceeds"
