They most commonly use the strategy of repeated reading —simply reading through books or notes over and over. We and other researchers have found that **this passive and shallow strategy often produces minimal or no learning**. We call this **“labor in vain”—students are putting in labor but not getting anywhere.**
Page 13

We do it because **we fall prey to a cognitive illusion.**

If you don’t (yet) consider yourself naturally good at math and science, you may be surprised to learn that the brain is designed to do extraordinary mental calculations.

In fact, we all have a natural feel and flair for math and science. Basically, we just need to master the lingo and culture.

**Prime Your Mental Pump**

Page 24

As you first begin looking at a chapter or section of a book that teaches concepts of math or science, it helps to** take a “picture walk” through the chapter, glancing not only at the graphics, diagrams, and photos, but also at the section headings, summary, and even questions at the end of the chapter,** if the book has them. This seems counterintuitive— you haven’t actually read the chapter yet, but it helps prime your mental pump. So go ahead now and glance through this chapter and the questions at the end of the chapter. You’ll be surprised at how spending a minute or two glancing ahead before you read in depth will help you organize your thoughts. You’re creating little neural hooks to hang your

thinking on, making it easier to grasp the concepts.

Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

Page 25

Since the very beginning of the twenty-first century, neuroscientists have been making profound advances in understanding the **two different types of networks that the brain switches between—highly attentive states and more relaxed resting state networks.**

Page 25

1We’ll call the thinking processes related to these two different types of networks the focused mode and diffuse mode, respectively—these modes are highly important for learning.

Page 25

The diffuse mode does seem to be able to **work quietly in the background on something you are not actively focusing on**. 3Sometimes you may also flicker for a rapid moment to diffuse-mode thinking.

Page 25

**Focused-mode thinking is essential for studying math and science.** It involves a direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential, analytical approaches.

Page 25

Diffuse-mode thinking is also essential for learning math and science. It allows us to suddenly gain a **new insight on a problem we’ve been struggling with and is associated with “big-picture” perspectives. ** Diffuse-mode thinking is what happens when you **relax your attention and just let your mind wander.**

Page 26

The Focused Mode—A Tight Pinball Machine

Page 26

When you focus on something, the consciously attentive prefrontal cortex automatically sends out signals along neural pathways.

Page 28
Figure
Page 28

**In this phenomenon, an idea you already have in mind, or your simple initial thought, prevents a better idea or solution from being found.**

Page 30

It’s called the **Einstellung effect** (pronounced EYE-nshtellung).

Page 30

This kind of wrong approach is especially easy to do in science because sometimes **your initial intuition about what’s happening is misleading**. You have to **unlearn your erroneous older ideas even while you’re learning new ones**.10

Page 30

This is precisely why one significant mistake students sometimes make in learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. 11In other words, they blindly start working on homework without reading the textbook, attending lecture…

Page 30

Understanding how to obtain real solutions is important, not only in math and science problem solving, but for life in general.

Page 30

The Diffuse Mode—A Spread-Out Pinball Machine

Page 30

Another way to think of the difference between focused and diffuse modes is to think of a flashlight. You can set a flashlight so it has a t**ightly focused beam that can penetrate deeply into a small area**. Or you can set the flashlight onto a more diffuse setting where it **casts its light broadly, but not very strongly in any one area.**

Page 31

If you are trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to **turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture” diffuse mode**, long enough to be able to latch on to a new, more fruitful approach.

Page 31

COUNTERINTUITIVE CREATIVITY

Page 31

I now follow the rule of thumb that is basically: **The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be.
**
Page 31

**Ultimately, this means that relaxation is an important part of hard work—and good work, for that matter.”**

Page 31

**To learn about and be creative in math and science, we need to strengthen and use both the focused and diffuse modes.**19

Page 32
Figure
Page 33

The bottom line is that problem solving in any discipline often involves an exchange between the two fundamentally different modes. One mode will process the information it receives and then send the result back to the other mode. This volleying of information back and forth as the brain works its way toward a conscious solution appears essential for understanding and solving all but trivial problems and concepts.

Page 34

Shifting Modes

Page 35

Here’s a cognitive exercise that can help you feel the shift from focused to diffuse mode. See whether you can form a new triangle that points down by moving only three coins. When you relax your mind, releasing your attention and focusing on nothing in particular, the solution can most easily come to you.

Page 35

You should know that some children get this exercise instantly, while some highly intelligent professors finally just give up. To answer this question, it helps to summon your inner child. The solutions for this challenge and for all the “Now You Try!” challenges in the book can be found in the endnotes.21

Procrastination Prelude

Page 35

**For now, keep in mind that when you procrastinate, you are leaving yourself only enough time to do superficial focused-mode learning.**

Page 35

You are also increasing your stress level because you know you have to complete what feels like an unpleasant task.

Focusing Intently but Briefly

Page 36

If you often find yourself procrastinating, as many of us do, here’s a tip. T**urn off your phone and any sounds or sights (or websites) that might signal an interruption.** Then set a timer for twenty-five minutes and put yourself toward doing a twenty-five-minute interlude of work focused on a task—any task. **Don’t worry about finishing the task—just worry about working on it.** Once the twenty-five minutes is up, **reward yourself with web surfing, checking your phone, or whatever you like to do. This reward is as important as the work itself.** You’ll be amazed at how productive a focused twenty-five-minute stint can be— especially when you’re just focusing on the work itself, not on finishing. (This method, known as the **Pomodoro technique**, will be discussed in more detail in chapter 6.) If you want to apply a more advanced version of this approach, imagine that at the end of the day, you are reflecting on the one most important task that you accomplished that day. What would that task be? Write it down. Then work on it. Try to complete at least three of these twenty-five-minute sessions that day, on whatever task or tasks you think are most important. At the end of your workday, look at what you crossed off your list and savor the feeling of accomplishment. Then write a few key things that you would like to work on the next day. This early preparation will help your diffuse mode begin to think about how you will get those tasks done the next day.

SUMMING IT UP

Page 36

Our brain uses two very different processes for thinking—the focused and diffuse modes. It seems you toggle back and forth between these modes, using one or the other.

Page 36

It is typical to be stumped by new concepts and problems when we first focus on them.

Page 36

To figure out new ideas and solve problems, it’s important not only to focus initially, but also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn.

Page 36

The Einstellung effect refers to getting stuck in solving a problem or understanding a concept as a result of becoming fixated on a flawed approach. Switching modes from focused to diffuse can help free you from this effect. Keep in mind, then, that sometimes you will need to be flexible in your thinking. You may need to switch modes to solve a problem or understand a concept. Your initial ideas about problem solving can sometimes be very misleading.

1**The key is to do something else until your brain is consciously free of any thought of the problem.**

Page 39

Creativity expert Howard Gruber has suggested that one of the three B’s usually seems to do the trick: the bed, the bath, or the bus.

Page 39

Once you are distracted from the problem at hand, the **diffuse mode has access and can begin pinging about in its big-picture way to settle on a solution**. 4After your break, when you return to the problem at hand, **you will often be surprised at how easily the solution pops into place.** Even if the solution doesn’t appear, you will often be further along in your understanding. It can take a lot of hard focused-mode work beforehand, but the sudden, unexpected solution that emerges from the diffuse mode can make it feel almost like the “aha!” mode.

Page 40

That twilight, disconnected feeling one experiences while drifting off to sleep was, it seems, part of the magic behind Edison’s extraordinary creativity. **When faced with a difficult problem, instead of focusing intently on it, Edison, according to legend, took a nap…**

Creativity Is about Harnessing and Extending Your Abilities

For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean theorem.

Read the following sentence and identify how many errors it contains:

Page 42

Thiss sentence contains threee errors.

Page 42

The first two errors are easily discovered using a focused-mode approach. The third, paradoxical error becomes obvious only when you change perspectives and adopt a more diffuse approach.8 (Remember, the solution is in the endnote.)

Page 42

9K**now that you are making progress with each mistake you catch when trying to solve a problem—finding errors should give you a sense of satisfaction.** Edison himself is said to have noted “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”

Page 42

Mistakes are inevitable. To work past them, start early on your assignments and, unless you are really enjoying what you are doing, **keep your working sessions short.**

Page 43

**Sleep is probably the most effective and important factor in allowing your diffuse mode to tackle a difficult problem.**

Page 43

One way to think of the **diffuse mode is as a base station when you are mountain climbing.** Base stations are essential resting spots in the long journey to difficult mountaintops. You use them to pause, reflect, check your gear, and make sure you’ve got the right route picked out. B…

Page 43

In other words, just using your diffuse mode doesn’t mean you can lollygag around and expect to get anywhere.

Page 43

Constantly lifting weights won’t make your muscles any bigger—your muscles need time to rest and grow before you use them again. Taking time off between weight sessions helps build strong muscles in the long run. **Consistency over time is key!**
Page 43

Students who are beginning to struggle in math and science often look at others who are intellectual racehorses and tell themselves they have to keep up.

Page 44

Especially in the early stages of college, **avoid the temptation to keep up with your peers.**

Page 45

Avoid Einstellung (Getting Stuck)

Page 45

Remember, accepting the first idea that comes to mind when you are working on an assignment or test problem can prevent you from finding a better solution.

Page 45

Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one or more periods when you aren’t consciously working on the problem.

Page 46

The resting times between your focused-mode efforts should be long enough to get your conscious mind completely off the problem you’re working on. Usually

Page 46

a few hours is long enough for the diffuse mode to make significant progress but not so long that its insights fade away before being passed on to the focused mode.

Page 47

This idea of **looking from fresh perspectives also gives us insight on why “sleeping on it” before making major decisions is generally a good idea,** 18and why taking vacations is important.

NOW YOU TRY!

Page 47

Observe Yourself

Page 47

**Next time you find yourself becoming frustrated at something or someone, try taking a mental step back and observing your reaction. Anger and frustration can occasionally have their place in motivating us to succeed, but they can also shut down key areas of the brain that we need in order to learn. Rising frustration is usually a good time-out signal for you, signaling that you need to shift to diffuse mode.**
Page 47

People with strong self-control can have the most difficulty in getting themselves to turn off their focused mode so that the diffuse mode can begin its work.

Understand the Paradoxes of Learning

Page 48

Learning is often paradoxical. The very thing we need in order to learn impedes our ability to learn.

Page 48

The very thing we need in order to learn impedes our ability to learn. We need to focus intently to be able to solve problems—yet that focus can also block us from accessing the fresh approach we may need. Success is important, but critically, so is failure. **Persistence is key—but misplaced persistence causes needless frustration.**

Page 48

Throughout this book, you will encounter many paradoxes of learning. Can you anticipate what some of them might be?

Introduction to Working and Long-Term Memory

Page 49

At this point, it’s helpful to touch on some of the basics of memory. For our purposes, we’re going to talk about only two major memory systems: **working memory and long-term memory**.19

Page 49

**Working memory is the part of memory that has to do with what you are immediately and consciously processing in your mind.**

Page 49

**In contrast, long-term memory might be thought of as a storage warehouse.**
Page 50

**It takes time to move information from working memory to long-term memory. To help with this process, use a technique called spaced repetition.**

Page 50

**Putting a day between bouts of repetition—extending your practice over a number of days—does make a difference.** Research has shown that if you try to glue things into your memory by repeating something twenty times in one evening, for example, it won’t stick nearly as well as it will if you practice it the same number of times over several days or weeks. 22T**his is similar to building the brick wall we saw earlier. If you don’t leave time for the mortar to dry (time for the synaptic connections to form and strengthen), you won’t have a very good structure.**

Page 50

Let Your Mind Work in the Background The next time you are tackling a tough problem, work on it for a few minutes. When you get stuck, move on to another problem. Your diffuse mode can continue working on the

Page 50

tougher problem in the background. When you later return to the tougher problem, you will often be pleasantly surprised by the progress you’ve made.

Page 51

The Importance of Sleep in Learning

Page 51

24Part of what this special sleep-time tidying does is **erase trivial aspects of memories and simultaneously strengthen areas of importance**. During sleep, your brain also rehearses some of the tougher parts of whatever you are trying to learn—going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.25

Page 51

**Studies have shown that sleep is a vital part of memory and learning.**
Page 51

27**Dreaming about what you are studying can substantially enhance your ability to understand—it somehow consolidates your memories into easier-to-grasp chunks.**28

Page 52

SUMMING IT UP

Page 52

Use the focused mode to first start grappling with concepts and problems in math and science.

Page 52

After you’ve done your first hard focused work, allow the diffuse mode to take over. Relax and do something different!

Page 52

When frustration arises, it’s time to switch your attention to allow the diffuse mode to begin working in the background.

Page 52

It’s best to work at math and science in small doses—a little every day. This gives both the focused and diffuse modes the time they need to do their thing so you can understand what you are learning. That’s how solid neural structures are built.

Page 53

If procrastination is an issue, try setting a timer for twenty-five minutes and focusing intently on your task without allowing yourself to be drawn aside by text messages, web surfing, or other attractive distractions.

Page 53

There are two major memory systems: Working memory—like a juggler who can keep only four items in the air. Long-term memory—like a storage warehouse that can hold large amounts of material, but needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible.

Page 53

Spaced repetition helps move items from working memory to long- term memory.

Page 53

Sleep is a critical part of the learning process. It helps you: Make the neural connections needed for normal thinking processes—which is why sleep the night before a test is so important. Figure out tough problems and find meaning in what you are learning. Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities.

Page 53

ENHANCE YOUR LEARNING 1. Name some activities you would find helpful for switching from focused to diffuse mode.

Page 53

Sometimes you can feel certain you have explored new approaches to analyzing a problem, when you actually haven’t. What can you do to become more actively aware of your thinking processes to help keep yourself open to other possibilities? Should you always keep yourself open to new possibilities?

Page 54

Why is it important to use self-control to make yourself stop doing something? Can you think of times outside studying and academics when this skill might also be important?

Page 54

When you are learning new concepts, you want to review the material within a day so that the initial changes you made in your brain don’t fade away. But your mind often becomes preoccupied with other matters—it’s easy to let several days or more pass before you get around to looking at the material. What kind of action plan could you develop to ensure that you review important new material in a timely fashion?

Dealing with fear: A motivational poster I received after giving a talk at Facebook headquarters reads: **“What would you do if you weren’t afraid?”** I try to look at this daily, and I aim to do something fearless every day. What are you afraid of? Don’t let it stop you!

The Keys to Becoming an “Equation Whisperer”

Page 57

**Focused attention, in other words, can often help solve problems, but it can also create problems by blocking our ability to see new solutions.**

Page 58

**Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning.** You can take the letters p, o, and p and bind them into one conceptual, easy-to- remember chunk, the word pop. It’s like converting a cumbersome computer file into a .zip file.

Page 60

As it turns out, one of the f**irst steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create conceptual chunks—mental leaps that unite separate bits of information through meaning.**

Page 61

**Once you chunk an idea or concept, you don’t need to remember all the little underlying details; you’ve got the main idea —the chunk—and that’s enough.**

Page 61

When you are studying math and science, then, how do you form a chunk?

Page 61

Basic Steps to Forming a Chunk

Page 61

**1. The first step in chunking, then, is to simply focus your attention on the information you want to chunk.**

Page 62
Figure
Page 62

have difficulty making a chunk, because your brain is not really focusing on the chunking. When you first begin to learn something, you are making new neural patterns and connecting them with preexisting patterns that are spread through many areas of the brain…

Page 63

2. **The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk, whether it is understanding a concept such as continental drift, the idea that force is proportional to mass, the economic principle of supply and demand, or a particul…**

Page 63

8Can you create a chunk if you don’t understand? Yes, but it’s a useless chunk that won’t fit in with other material you are learning.

Page 63

3. **The third step to chunking is gaining context so you see not just how, but also when to use this chunk.**

Page 63

**Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems so you see not only when to use the chunk, but when not to use it.**

Page 63

(Trust me, you will make errors, and that’s a good thing.) It also makes it much easier to apply your knowledge to novel problems, a phenomenon called transfer. We’ll talk more about transfer later.

Page 64

As you can see from the following “top-down, bottom-up” illustration, learning takes place in two ways. There is a b**ottom-up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk**, so you can easily gain access to it when needed. And there is a **top-down “big picture” process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in…**

Page 64

9Both processes are vital in gaining mastery over the material.

Page 64

Attempting to recall the material you are trying to learn—**retrieval practice —is far more effective than simply rereading the material.**

Page 66

10Psychologist **Jeffrey Karpicke and his colleagues have shown that many students experience illusions of competence when they are studying.** Most students, Karpicke found,

Page 66

“**repeatedly read their notes or textbook** (despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but **relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practice while studying.**” 11When you have the book (or Google!) open right in front of you, it provides the illusion that the material is also in your brain. But it’s not. Because it can be easier to look at the book instead of recalling, students persist in their illusion—studying in a far less productive way.

Page 67

As Alan Baddeley, a renowned psychologist and expert on memory, notes: **“Intention to learn is helpful only if it leads to the use of good learning strategies.”**

Page 67

==**When marking up the text, train yourself to look for main ideas before making any marks, and keep your text markings to a minimum— one sentence or less per paragraph.**==

Page 67

Using recall—mental retrieval of the key ideas—rather than passive rereading will make your study time more focused and effective.

Page 67

**You don’t want to wait too long for the recall practice,** so that you have to start the reinforcement of the concept from scratch every time. Try to touch again on something you’re learning within a day, especially if it’s new and rather challenging.

Page 67

**Knowing where the holes are, of course, is the first step toward getting them filled in.**

Page 68

“Getting a concept in class versus being able to apply it to a genuine physical problem is the difference between a simple student and a full-blown scientist or engineer. The only way I know of to make that jump is to **work with the concept until it becomes second nature, so you can begin to use it like a tool.**”

Page 68

Later, we’ll discuss useful apps and programs that can help with learning. But for now, it’s worth knowing that well-designed electronic flash card systems, such as **Anki**, have built into them the appropriate spaced repetition time to optimize the rate of learning new material.

Page 68

Merely glancing at the solution to a problem and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusions of competence in learning.

Page 69

Understanding Illusions of Competence

Page 70

Anagrams are rearrangements of letters so that one word or phrase can spell something different. Let’s say you have the phrase “Me, radium ace.” Can you rearrange it to spell the last name of a honorific famous physicist?17 It may take you a bit of thought to do it. But if you saw the solution here on the page, your subsequent “aha!” feeling would make you think that your anagram-solving skills are better than they actually are. Similarly, students often erroneously believe that they are learning by simply rereading material that is on the page in front of them. They have an illusion of competence because the solution is already there.18 **Pick a mathematical or scientific concept from your notes or from a page in the book. Read it over, then look away and see what you can recall—working toward understanding what you are recalling at the same time. **Then glance back, reread the concept, and try it again. At the end of this exercise, you will probably be surprised to see how much this simple recall exercise helped improve your understanding of the concept.

Page 70

Y**ou must have information persisting in your memory if you are to master the material well enough to do well on tests and think creatively with it.**

This is where the Law of Serendipity comes to play: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.23

Most difficult problems are solved through intuition, because they make a leap away from what you are familiar with.

Page 71

What to Do If You Can’t Grasp It If you don’t understand a method presented in a course you are taking, stop and work backward. Go to the Internet and discover who first figured out the method or some of the earliest people to use it. Try to understand how the creative inventor arrived at the idea and why the idea is used—you can often find a simple explanation that gives a basic sense of why a method is being taught and why you would want to use it.

Page 72

**Practice Makes Permanent**

Page 72

The challenge with repetition and practice, which lie behind the mind’s creation of solid chunks, is that **it can be boring.**

Page 74

**But you can’t learn mathematics or science without also including a healthy dose of practice and repetition to help you build the chunks that will underpin your expertise.**

Page 74

In the same amount of time, by simply practicing and recalling the material, students learned far more and at a much deeper level than they did using any other approach, including simply rereading the text a number of times or drawing concept maps that sup…

Page 74

When we retrieve knowledge, we’re not being mindless robots—t**he retrieval process itself enhances deep learning and helps us begin forming chunks.**

Page 74

I also talk about the **need to study every day**, not necessarily for long periods of time but just enough to keep what you are learning at the tip of your tongue.

Page 75

**Recall Material While Outside Your Usual Place of Study: The Value of Walking**

Page 75

Doing something physically active is especially helpful when you have trouble grasping a key idea. As mentioned earlier, **stories abound of innovative scientific breakthroughs that occurred when the people who made them were out walking**

Page 75

In addition, recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study helps you strengthen your grasp of the material by viewing it from a different perspective.

Page 75

Different types of problems have different review time frames that are specific to your own learning speed and style. 34And of course, you have other obligations in your life besides learning one particular topic. You have to prioritize how much you’re able to do, also keeping in mind that you must schedule some time off to keep your diffuse mode in play. How much internalizing can you do at a stretch? It depends—everyone is different. But, here’s the real beauty of internalizing problem solutions in math and science. **The more you do it, the easier it becomes, and the more useful it is.**

Page 76

Interleaving—Doing a Mixture of Different Kinds of Problems— versus Overlearning

Page 77

**Interleaving means practice by doing a mixture of different kinds of problems requiring different strategies.**

Page 77

**Continuing the study or practice after it is well understood is called overlearning.**

Page 77

In summary, then, once you’ve got the basic idea down during a session, continuing to hammer away at it during the same session doesn’t necessarily strengthen the kinds of long-term memory connections you want to have strengthened.

The reality is, mastering a new subject means learning to select and use the proper technique for a problem.

Page 77

The only way to learn that is by practicing with problems that require different techniques.

“Many people believe overlearning means studying or practicing until mastery is achieved. However, in the research literature, overlearning refers to a learning strategy in which a student continues to study or practice immediately after some criterion has been achieved. An example might be correctly solving a certain kind of math problem and then immediately working several more problems of the same kind. Although working more problems of the same kind (rather than fewer) often boosts scores on a subsequent test, doing too many problems of the same kind in immediate succession provides diminishing returns. “In the classroom and elsewhere, students should maximize the amount they learn per unit time spent studying or practicing—that is, they should get the most bang for the buck. How can students do this? The scientific literature provides an unequivocal answer: **Rather than devote a long session to the study or practice of the same skill or concept so that overlearning occurs, students should divide their effort across several shorter sessions.** This doesn’t mean that long study sessions are necessarily a bad idea. Long sessions are fine as long as students don’t devote too much time to any one skill or concept. Once they understand ‘X,’ they should move on to something else and return to ‘X’ on another day.”40

Next time you are with a family member, friend, or classmate, relate the essence of what you have been learning, either from this book or in regard to a class you are taking. Retelling whatever you are learning about not only helps fuel and share your own enthusiasm, but also clarifies and cements the ideas in your mind, so you’ll remember them better in the weeks and months to come. Even if what you are studying is very advanced, simplifying so you can explain to others who do not share your educational background can be surprisingly helpful in building your understanding.

1. Read (but don’t yet solve) assigned homework and practice exams/quizzes. With this initial step I prime my mental pump for learning new concepts—new chunks.

Page 83

2. Review lecture notes (attend every lecture as much as possible). One hour of lecture is worth two hours reading the book. I learn far more efficiently if I am faithful in attending lectures and taking detailed notes—not just staring at my watch and waiting for it to be over. I review my notes the following day while the subjects are still fresh in my mind. I’ve also found that thirty minutes with a professor asking questions is easily worth three hours reading the book.

Page 83

3. Rework example problems presented in lecture notes. It never helped me to practice problems given by either the instructor or the textbook that didn’t have solutions to provide feedback. With the example problems I already had a step-by- step solution available if necessary. Reworking helps solidify chunks. I use different- colored pens when I study: blue, green, red—not just black. I found that it helps me focus on reading my notes better; things pop out more, instead of blending together into a confusing collage of inexplicable mathematical chaos on the page.

First things first. Unlike procrastination, which is easy to fall into, **willpower is hard to come by because it uses a lot of neural resources.**

Procrastination and Discomfort

For most people, learning math and science depends on two things: brief study sessions where the neural “bricks” are laid, and time in between for the mental mortar to dry.

Page 85

**We procrastinate about things that make us feel uncomfortable**.4 Medical imaging studies have shown that mathphobes, for example, appear to avoid math because even just thinking about it seems to hurt.

Page 85

But there’s something important to note. **It was the anticipation that was painful.** When the mathphobes actually did math, the pain disappeared.

Page 86

**Procrastination expert Rita Emmett explains: “The dread of doing a task uses up more time and energy than doing the task itself.**”6

Page 86

Procrastination is a single, monumentally important “keystone” bad habit. 7A habit, in other words, that influences many important areas of your life.

Page 86

And there’s something more—something crucially important. **It’s easy to feel distaste for something you’re not good at. But the better you get at something, the more you’ll find you enjoy it.**

Digging Deeper to Understand the Habit of Procrastination

Page 92

1Habit is an energy saver for us. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.

Page 92

But you quickly learned how to chunk this information so that before you knew it, all you have to do was think Let’s go, and you were backing out of the driveway. Your brain goes into a sort of zombie mode, where it isn’t consciously aware of everything it is doing…

Page 92

Habits have four parts:

Page 93

The Cue: This is the trigger that launches you into “zombie mode.” The cue may be something as simple as seeing the first item on your to- do list (time to start next week’s homework!) or seeing a text message from a friend (time to dawdle!). A cue by itself is neither helpful nor harmful. It’s the routine—what we do in reaction to that cue—that matters.

Page 93

The Routine: This is your zombie mode—the routine, habitual response your brain is used to falling into when it receives the cue. Zombie responses can be harmless, useful, or, in the worst case, so destructive that they defy common sense.

Page 93

The Reward: Habits develop and continue because they reward us— give us a dollop of pleasure. Procrastination is an easy habit to develop because the reward—moving your mind’s focus to something more pleasant—happens so quickly. But good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good study habits in math and science is vital to escaping procrastination.

Page 93

The Belief: Habits have power because of your belief in them. For example, you might feel that you’ll never be able to change your habit of putting off your studies until late in the day. To change a habit, you’ll need to change your underlying belief.

Page 93

The Cue: Recognize what launches you into your zombie, procrastination mode. Cues usually fall into one of the following categories: location, time, how you feel, reactions to other people, or something that just happened. 2Do you look something up on the web and then find yourself web surfing? Does a text message disturb your reverie, taking you ten minutes to get back into the flow of things even when you try to keep yourself on task? The issue with procrastination is that because it’s an automatic habit, you are often unaware that you have begun to procrastinate. Students often find that developing new cues, such as starting homework as soon as they get home from school or right after their first break from class, are helpful. As procrastination expert Piers Steel, author of The Procrastination Equation, points out, “If you protect your routine, eventually it will protect you.”3

Page 94

The Routine: Let’s say that instead of doing your studies, you often divert your attention to something less painful.

Page 95

The key to rewiring is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful.

Page 95

The Pomodoro technique—the twenty-five-minute timer—can be especially helpful in shifting your reaction to cues.

Page 95

The Reward: This can sometimes require investigation. Why are you procrastinating? Can you substitute in an emotional payoff? A feeling of pride for accomplishing something, even if it is small? A sense of satisfaction? Can you win a small internal bet or contest in something you’ve turned into a personal game? Allow yourself to indulge in a latte or read a favorite website? Provide yourself with an evening of mindless television or web surfing without guilt? And will you give yourself a bigger reward for a bigger achievement—movie tickets, a sweater, or an utterly frivolous purchase?

Page 96

Remember, habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings. It helps to add a new reward if you want to overcome your previous cravings. Only once your brain starts expecting the reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits.

Page 96

This rewiring, sometimes called learned industriousness, helps brighten tasks you once thought were boring and uninteresting.

Page 96

The Belief: The most important part of changing your procrastination habit is the belief that you can do it.

Page 97

Belief that your new system works is what can get you through.

Page 97

Hang out with classmates who have the “can do” philosophy that you want to develop. Developing an encouraging culture with like-minded friends can help us remember the values that, in moments of weakness, we tend to forget.

Page 97

A powerful approach is mental contrasting. 6In this technique, you think about where you are now and contrast it with what you want to achieve.

Page 97

If you’re trying to get into medical school, for example, imagine yourself as a doctor, helping others even as you’re preparing for a great vacation that you can actually afford. Once you’ve got that upbeat image in mind, contrast it with images of your current life. Imagine your clunker of a car, your macaroni and cheese dinners, and your mountain of student debts. Yet there’s hope!

Page 97

Practicing Your Zombie Wrangling Do you like to check your e-mail or Facebook right when you wake up in the morning? Set a timer for ten minutes of work first thing instead—then reward yourself with online time. You will be surprised to see that this tiny exercise in self-control will help empower you over your zombies through the day. Warning: When you first sit down to try this, some of your zombies will scream as if they want to eat your brain. Tune them out! Part of the point of this exercise is learning to laugh at your zombies’ antics as they predictably tell you, “Just this once it’s okay to check Facebook right now.”

Page 99

Get into the Flow by Focusing on Process, Not Product

Page 99

Process means the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time—as in, “I’m going to spend twenty minutes working.”

Page 99

To prevent procrastination, you want to avoid concentrating on product. Instead, your attention should be on building processes—habits—that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant tasks that need to be done.

Page 99

Your challenge here is to avoid focusing on the product—the solved homework problems. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate.

Page 99

Break Your Work into Bite-Sized Pieces—Then Work Intently, but Briefly

Page 100

The “Pomodoro” is a technique that’s been developed to help you focus your attention over a short period of time. Pomodoro is Italian for “tomato”—Francesco Cirillo, who originally developed this time- management system in the 1980s, used a tomato-shaped timer.

Page 100

You may object that it is stressful being under the timer. But researchers have found something fascinating and counterintuitive. If you learn under mild stress, you can handle greater stress much more easily.

Page 100

In the same way, if you get used to figuring things out under a mild time crunch, you are much less likely to choke later, when you

Page 100

are in a high-pressure test-taking situation.

Page 101

Focusing on process, not product, is important in avoiding procrastination. It is the consistent, daily time you spend getting into the flow of your studies that matters most. Focus on doing a Pomodoro—a twenty-five-minute timed work session—not on completing a task.

Page 101

The key is, when the distraction arises, which it inevitably will, you want to train yourself to ignore it. One of the single most important pieces of advice I can give you on dealing with procrastination is to ignore distractions! Of course, setting yourself up so that distractions are minimal is also a good idea…

Page 102

By focusing on process rather than product, you

Page 102

allow yourself to back away from judging yourself (Am I getting closer to finishing?) and allow yourself to relax into the flow of the work.

Page 103

Multitasking is like constantly pulling up a plant. This kind of constant shifting of your attention means that new ideas and concepts have no chance to take root and flourish.

Page 103

Ignorance Is Bliss

Page 104

Next time you feel the urge to check your messages, pause and examine the feeling. Acknowledge it. Then ignore it. Practice ignoring distractions. It is a far more powerful technique than trying to will yourself to not feel those distractions in the first place.

Page 104

A little bit of work on something that feels painful can ultimately be very beneficial.

Habits such as procrastination have four parts: The cue The routine The reward The belief Change a habit by responding differently to a cue, or even avoiding that cue altogether.

The belief Change a habit by responding differently to a cue, or even avoiding that cue altogether. Reward and belief make the change long-lasting.

Focus on the process (the way you spend your time) instead of the product (what you want to accomplish).

Page 104

Use the twenty-five-minute Pomodoro to stay productive for brief periods. Then reward yourself after each successful period of focused attention.

Be sure to schedule free time to nurture your diffuse mode.

Mental contrasting is a powerful motivating technique—think about the worst aspects of your present or past experiences and contrast these with the upbeat vision of your future.

Multitasking means that you are not able to make full, rich connections in your thinking, because the part of your brain that helps make connections is constantly being pulled away before neural connections can be firmed up.

Hitting the Wall—When Your Knowledge Suddenly Seems to Collapse

Page 112

Learning doesn’t progress logically so that each day just adds an additional neat packet to your knowledge shelf. Sometimes you hit a wall in constructing your understanding.

Page 112

Remember—it takes time to assimilate new knowledge. You will go through some periods when you seem to take an exasperating step backward in your understanding. This a natural phenomenon that means your mind is wrestling deeply with the material. You’ll find that when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration, your knowledge base will take a surprising step forward.

“A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition. I mean that in learning by heart (for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again. If we recover the words in the former way, we shall probably know them the next time; if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book once more.”

Testing Is a Powerful Learning Experience—Give Yourself Little Mini-Tests Constantly

Page 113

Here’s one of the most important reasons to have well-chunked solution methods readily in mind: They help prevent choking on tests.

Page 113

Choking—panicking to the point where you freeze—can happen when your working memory is filled to capacity, yet you still don’t have enough room for the additional critical pieces you need to solve a problem.

Page 113

Testing in itself is a powerful learning experience. It changes and adds to what you know, also making dramatic improvements in your ability to retain the material.

Page 113

It seems to occur because testing strengthens and stabilizes the related neural

Page 113

patterns in your brain.

Page 114

This is precisely what we saw in chapter 4, in the “Practice Makes Permanent” section, with the picture of the darkening patterns in the brain that occurs with repetition.

SUMMING IT UP

Page 114

Chunking means integrating a concept into one smoothly connected neural thought pattern.

Page 114

Chunking helps increase the amount of working memory you have available.

Page 114

Building a chunked library of concepts and solutions helps build intuition in problem solving. When you are building a chunked library, it’s important to keep deliberate focus on some of the toughest concepts and aspects of problem solving. Occasionally you can study hard and fate deals a bad hand. But remember the Law of Serendipity: If you prepare well by practicing and building a good mental library, you will find that luck will be increasingly on your side. In other words, you guarantee failure if you don’t try, but those who consistently give it a good effort will experience many more successes.

Page 115

What does chunking have to do with working memory?

Page 115

Why do you need to solve a problem yourself as part of the chunking process? Why can’t you just look at the solution in the back of the book, understand it, and then move on? What are some additional things you can do to help smooth your chunks right before a test?

Page 115

What is the testing effect?

Once you’ve practiced a problem a few times, pause and see if you can sense the feeling of rightness that occurs when you realize what the next step in the solution process is.

What is the Law of Serendipity? Think of an example from your own experiences that typifies this idea.

To a great degree, the highest- performing people I know are those who have installed the best tricks in their lives . . .

Your own self-experimentation, at least to begin with, should be on procrastination. Keep notes on when you don’t complete what you had intended to complete, what the cues are, and your zombie-mode habitual reaction to procrastination cues.

It’s important to transform distant deadlines into daily ones. Attack them bit by bit. Big tasks need to be translated into smaller ones that show up on your daily task list. The only way to walk a journey of a thousand miles is to take one step at a time.

Chronic procrastinators, as it turns out, tend to see each act of procrastination as a unique, unusual act, a “just this one time” phenomenon that won’t be repeated again.

A little procrastination here and there is unavoidable. But to be effective in learning math and science, you must master your habits. Your zombies must be under your control. Your planner-journal serves as your eyes to keep track of what works. When you first start using a task list, you will often find that you’ve been too ambitious—there’s no way to accomplish it all. But as you fine-tune, you will quickly learn how to set sensible, doable goals.

Getting a grip on habits of procrastination means acknowledging that something that feels painful at the moment can ultimately be healthy.

Wise Waiting

Page 133

A healthy form of procrastination entails learning to pause and reflect before jumping in and accomplishing something. You are learning to wait wisely. There is always something to be done. Prioritizing allows you to gain big-picture context for your decision making. Sometimes waiting allows a situation to resolve itself.

Page 133

Pausing and reflecting are key, not only in stopping procrastination but in math and science problem solving in general.

Page 133

You may be surprised to learn that the difference in the way that math experts (professors and graduate students) and math novices (undergraduate students) solve physics problems is that experts are slower to begin solving a problem.

Page 133

Pausing gives you time to access your library of chunks and allows your brain to make connections between a particular problem and the bigger picture.

Page 133

The proof is in the outcome: Over the past decades, students who have blindly followed their passion, without rational analysis of whether their choice of career truly was wise, have been more unhappy with their job choices than those who coupled passion with rationality.8

As I got good, the passion also came.

Page 134

The mistake is thinking that if we aren’t good at something, we do not have and can never develop a passion for it.

We develop a passion for what we are good at.

Procrastination FAQs

Page 135

I’m so overwhelmed by how much I’ve got to do that I avoid thinking about it, even though it only makes my bad situation worse. What can I do when I feel paralyzed by the enormity of the work I need to do? Write down three “microtasks” that you can do within a few minutes. Remember how Lady Luck favors those who try—just do your best to focus on something worthwhile. At this point, close your eyes and tell your mind that you have nothing else to worry about, no other concerns, just your first microtask. (I’m not kidding about the “close your eyes” part— remember, that can help disengage you from your previous thought patterns.9) You may want to play a Pomodoro game with yourself. Can you get a start on the first few pages of the chapter in twenty-five minutes? Accomplishing a lot of difficult tasks is like eating a salami. You go slice by slice—bit by bit. Cheer every accomplishment, even the tiniest ones. You’re moving ahead!

SUMMING IT UP Procrastination is such an important topic that this summary includes key takeaway points from all this book’s chapters on overcoming procrastination:

Page 139

Keep a planner-journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn’t work.

Page 139

Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.

Page 139

Write your planned tasks out the night before, so your brain has time to dwell on your goals to help ensure success.

Page 139

Arrange your work into a series of small challenges. Always make sure you (and your zombies!) get lots of rewards. Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph.

Page 139

Deliberately delay rewards until you have finished a task. Watch for procrastination cues.

Page 139

Put yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library.

Page 139

Obstacles arise, but don’t make a practice of blaming all your problems on external factors. If everything is always somebody else’s fault, it’s time to start looking in the mirror.

Page 139

Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration—and also trust your system enough that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt.

Page 139

Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate. No one is perfect, after all.

Can You Remember Where Your Kitchen Table Is? Your Supersized Visuospatial Memory

Page 143

It may surprise you to learn that we have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems.

Page 143

Here’s what I mean about your good visual and spatial memory. If you were asked to look around a house you’d never visited before, you would soon have a sense of the general furniture layout, where the rooms were, the color scheme, the pharmaceuticals in the bathroom cupboard (whoa!). In just a few minutes, your mind would acquire and retain thousands of new pieces of information. Even weeks later, you’d still hold far more in your mind than if you’d spent the same amount of time staring at a blank wall. Your mind is built to retain this kind of general information about a place.

The memory tricks used by both ancient and modern memory experts taps into these naturally supersized visuospatial memorization abilities.

The Memory Palace Technique

Page 145

The memory palace technique involves calling to mind a familiar place—like the layout of your house—and using it as a sort of visual notepad where you can deposit concept-images that you want to remember.

Page 145

Let’s say you are trying to remember the mineral hardness scale, which ranges from 1 to 10 (talc 1, gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10). You can come up with a memory sentence mnemonic: Terrible Giants Can Find Alligators or Quaint Trolls Conveniently Digestible. The problem is that it can still be difficult to remember the sentence…

Page 145

But things become easier if you then add the memory palace.

Page 145

The first time you do this, it will be slow.

Page 146

One study showed that a person using the memory palace technique could remember more than 95 percent of a forty-to-fifty-item list after only one or two practice mental “walks” where the items were placed on the grounds of the local university.

Page 146

Use the Memory Palace

Page 147

Top anatomy professor Tracey Magrann applies the memory palace technique to learning the five layers of the epidermis: “The epidermis has five layers. From deep to superficial, they are the stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum. To remember which one is the deepest layer, visualize your basement. That is the stratum basale. To get from your basement (deepest layer) to the roof (superficial layer), walk up your basement stairs . . . be careful! They are covered with cactus spines (stratum spinosum). That leads you to the kitchen, where someone has spilled granulated sugar all over the floor (stratum granulosum). Then you go upstairs and stop to put on suntan lotion before you go to the roof. The stratum lucidum is like a layer of suntan lotion because it protects you from UV rays but is present only on the palms and soles, so that’s where you picture yourself applying the lotion. Now you are ready to go to the roof and enjoy a nice corn on the cob (stratum corneum).”

Can you think of a way to use the memory palace in your studies?

Page 147

Songs that help cement ideas in your mind are related to the memory palace technique in that they also make preferential use of the brain’s right hemisphere.

Page 147

They help remind you that meaning is important for remembering, even if the initial meaning is wacky. In short, memorization techniques remind you to make what you learn in your life meaningful, memorable, and fun.

Learning to use your memory in a more disciplined, yet creative manner helps you learn to focus your attention, even as you create wild, diffuse connections that build stronger memories.

By memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way. And you are reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material.

2. Pick any listing of four or more key ideas or concepts from any of your classes. Describe how you would encode those ideas as memorable images and tell where you would deposit them in your memory palace. (For your teacher’s sake, you will want to censor some of your more memorable images. As a witty British actress once said, “I don’t care what they do, as long as they don’t do it in the street and frighten the horses.”)

Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

Page 151

One of the best things you can do to not only remember but understand concepts in math and science is to create a metaphor or analogy for it—often, the more visual, the better.

Page 151

2But never mind that—metaphors (and models!) are vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the mathematical or scientific process or concept that you are trying to understand.

Page 152

Spaced Repetition to Help Lodge Ideas in Memory

Page 153

Focusing your attention brings something into your temporary working memory. But for that “something” to move from working memory to long-term memory, two things should happen: the idea should be memorable (there’s a gigantic flying mule braying f = ma on my couch!), and it must be repeated…

Page 153

Repetition is important; even when you make something memorable, repetition helps get that memorable item firmly lodged in long-term memory. But how many times should you repeat? How long should you wait between repetitions?6 And is there anything you can …

Page 154

Writing appears to help you to more deeply encode (that is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are trying to learn.

Page 155

This is why it’s wise to be careful about what you decide to skip when reviewing for tests. Your memory for related but nonreviewed material can become impaired.

Page 155

Create Meaningful Groups

Page 156

Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Let’s say you wanted to remember four plants that help ward off vampires—garlic, rose, hawthorn, and mustard. The first letters abbreviate to GRHM, so all you need to do is remember the image of a GRAHAM cracker. (Retrieve your cracker from the kitchen table of your memory palace, dust off the vowels, and you’re good to go.)

Many disciplines use memorable sentences to help students memorize concepts; the first letter of each word in the sentence is also the first letter of each word in a list that needs to be memorized.

If you really want to boost your memory as well as your general ability to learn, it seems one of the best ways to do it is to exercise.

Several recent experiments in both animals and humans have found that regular exercise can make a substantive improvement in your memory and learning abilities.

Memory Tricks Help You Become an Expert More Quickly

Page 159

Here’s the bottom line. By using mental pictures instead of words to remember things, you can leap more easily into expert status. In other words, learning to process ideas visually in math and science is a powerful way to become a master of the material. 13And using other memory tricks can greatly enhance your ability to learn and retain the material.

Page 159

The more you memorize using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become. This is because you are building wild, unexpected possibilities for future connections early on, even as you are first internalizing the ideas.

Metaphors can help you learn difficult ideas more quickly.

Repetition is critical in allowing you to firm up what you want to remember before the ideas fade away.

Page 161

Meaningful groups and abbreviations can allow you to simplify and chunk what you are trying to learn so you can store it more easily in memory.

Page 161

Stories—even if they are just used as silly memory tricks—can allow you to more easily retain what you are trying to learn.

Writing and saying what you are trying to learn seems to enhance retention.

Cajal felt the key to his success was his perseverance (the “virtue of the less brilliant”2) coupled with his flexible ability to change his mind and admit errors.

Anyone, Cajal noted, even people with average intelligence, can sculpt their own brain, so that even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest.3
