Habakkuk starts to complain...

>2 How long, Lord, must I call for help,
    but you do not listen?
Or cry out to you, “Violence!”
    but you do not save?
3 Why do you make me look at injustice?
    Why do you tolerate wrongdoing?
Destruction and violence are before me;
    there is strife, and conflict abounds.
4 Therefore the law is paralyzed,
    and justice never prevails.
The wicked hem in the righteous,
    so that justice is perverted.
	
The Lord answers...

>5 “Look at the nations and watch—
    and be utterly amazed.
==For I am going to do something in your days
    that you would not believe,
    even if you were told.==
6 I am raising up the Babylonians,
    that ruthless and impetuous people,
who sweep across the whole earth
    to seize dwellings not their own.
7 They are a feared and dreaded people;
    they are a law to themselves
    and promote their own honor.
8 Their horses are swifter than leopards,
    fiercer than wolves at dusk.
Their cavalry gallops headlong;
    their horsemen come from afar.
They fly like an eagle swooping to devour;
9     they all come intent on violence.
Their hordes advance like a desert wind
    and gather prisoners like sand.
10 They mock kings
    and scoff at rulers.
They laugh at all fortified cities;
    by building earthen ramps they capture them.
11 Then they sweep past like the wind and go on—
    guilty people, whose own strength is their god.”
	
The lord assures Habakkuk of His promise...
>3 For the revelation awaits an appointed time;
    it speaks of the end
    and will not prove false.
Though it linger, wait for it;
    it will certainly come
    and will not delay.
	
Habakkuk thought that Jesus would tolerate suffering and pain, but little did he know He comes in glorious times where He would save His people from their sins and rescue them from their enemies. The Lord reminds us that 
## **HE MOST CERTAINTLY FULFILL HIS PROMISES**. Again, we just have to [[When God seems silent, wait on Him|wait]].
