In this theorem, it states that for a function continuous at the interval [a,b] and differentiable at the (a,b), there is a point in the function wherein the average rate of change is equal to the instantaneous rate of change. This means that the slope of the secant line is equal to the slope of the tangent line (derivative of the function).
