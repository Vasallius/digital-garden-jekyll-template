### Should i use subtitles

If you're reading subtitles, you spend some, if not most of your time reading the subtitles. This may be considered as [[Different types of listening immersion|passive listening.]] Generally, we would want to watch something and then try to understand what's going on by just listening to the characters talk. At the beginning you my want to use english subtitles, then later move on to korean subtitles as you learn Hanggul.

Maybe you encounter words you want to look up. See: [[Should i look things up]].
