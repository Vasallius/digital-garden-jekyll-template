# ⭐️ Small Steps Toward Success ⭐️ 

 

Have you ever wondered how successful people achieved success? I'm certain everyone has googled, "how to be successful fast" at some point in your lives, and everyone got the same answer —it really doesn't come easily, but I can help you take the small steps that will lead you closer to it. 

 

We all know that success doesn't happen overnight. It's a slow and gruelling process, but nonetheless an extremely rewarding undertaking. Success is actually a product of small repetitive habits that generate remarkable results. 

 

In my attempts to reach success, I stumbled upon a book written by[ James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/) entitled, "Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results." Together, let's embark on this journey toward our own successes. Onward! 

## What are atomic habits? 

Atomic habits are defined as the **building blocks of remarkable results**. Just as how atoms make up everything, one cannot achieve success without getting the crucial fundamental habits down pat. 

 

Simply put, atomic habits are small habits that seem trivial; however, you will find that as you continue to do them, their value in terms of reaching success just escalates drastically. The effort exerted into making these tiny but mighty habits is now incomparable to the degree of success achieved from making the changes. 

 

So why exactly do these tiny habits produce great results? Enter compounding.

## Compounding

Compounding, as defined by[ Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compounding.asp), is the process in which an asset's earnings, from either[ capital gains](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgain.asp) or[ interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp), are reinvested to generate additional earnings over time. 

 

Basically, you are earning interest from interest that's reinvested, which leads to more money over time. Yay!

 

Similarly, habits that seem insignificant will compound into something substantial if we consistently do them because the effects of our habits multiply and increase proportionally to the number of repetitions made.

 

To give you an example, being 1% better everyday for a year, actually makes you **37% better** after one year. Pretty good, right? Who wouldn't want to be a better person? On the contrary, being 1% worse everyday makes you nearly **98% worse** by the end of the year. Now that sucks.

But as naturally impatient human beings, we expect immediate results and massive changes just because we're doing something better. We become disappointed and stop doing good habits when we don't see improvements from them or get the results that we want overnight.

 

The **Plateau of Latent Potential** demonstrates this. We fail to realize that results from compounding are not linear but rather exponential in nature. Our take on what we expect will happen and what actually happens is commonly mismatched.

 ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201004135909.png]]

This is the difficult part —getting through the Valley of Disappointment, where everyone ventures into but not all manage to get past it. 

 

Most people quit, thinking that small habits have minute value. But little do they know, the results may be **disappointing or** **unnoticeable at first**; however, as time goes by, **the results** increase exponentially**, far greater than we anticipated. 

 

We can easily overcome the Valley of Disappointment. All we have to do is shift our focus on our systems instead of our goals. 

## Systems vs Goals

Contrary to popular belief, James Clear advises us to **forget goals** as they do not matter; we are to simply **focus on building our systems** instead. 

 

Goals are the results we aim to achieve and accomplish over a short period of time or even for a lifetime. For a student, his goal could be to graduate as top of the class.  

 

Systems, on the other hand, are the processes that lead to the desired results. If that student wants to graduate with the highest marks, then his systems would be how he studies, manages his time effectively, and passes his requirements while meeting the deadline.

 

If you want progress, focus on your systems. That could be the reason why you haven't made much progress. Sloppy systems are unsuitable methods of achieving goals that result in a pile of unaccomplished goals. 

 

Hence, we must shift our mindset and place utmost importance on building our systems instead of setting our eyes on the prize. If focusing on our goals did not work before, why would it now? All we need are organized and efficient systems that are carefully deliberated on to enable us to reach our goals. 

 

We spend a ridiculous amount of time thinking about them when that time can be spent mulling over building an effective system that would bring us closer to our goals over time.

 

The author, James Clear, lists some problems that arise when we focus too much on goals.

 1. Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.

	Both competitors enter a competition having the same goal, to win. Having the same goals contributed nothing to the victory or defeat of either competitor. It all depended on their individual systems to help them win or lose. 

2. Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.

	Think about what comes after achieving your goal and the systems you had that led to it. Your success lasts only **for a moment** if you fail to address the system that created the temporary results in the first place. We may think that our results need fixing, but in reality, it is our systems that need to be fixed. A problem will not constantly arise once there is a system made to address it. 


3. Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.

	Get rid of the notion that we will only be happy once we achieve our goals. Restricting yourself to either achieve the goal and be successful or fail and feel like a disappointment is an unhealthy, warped, and narrow-minded perspective. A remedy to this is by truly appreciating and enjoying the process, and happiness will automatically follow.


4. Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.

	James Clear said it best here:

	> _"The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment_."

 

As we all know by now, our system is the main reason why we struggle to change our habits. Our systems make it conducive for our bad habits to thrive; thus, we are not able to correct them.

 

_"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."_

 

**_Work on your systems._**

## Behavior Change

Have you ever wondered why we repeat bad habits but struggle to make good ones?

 

Changing our habits is difficult because:

- We are trying to change the wrong thing,

- We try to change our habits in the wrong way. 

Let's address the first reason. 

There are three layers to behavior change.

![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201004135945.png]]
 

The first outer layer are outcomes. They deal with changing your results — becoming a straight-A student. 

 
The second middle layer are processes, which are centered upon changing your systems and habits. The process of becoming a straight-A student may be attributed to your study habits and time management. 

 

The final inner layer is identity, which encompasses changing your beliefs, worldviews, self-image, and judgments about yourself and others. 

 

All layers of behavior change are beneficial, but the way to change our habits successfully is by following the **right direction of change**.

 

Outcome-based habits are built when people place so much importance on outcomes. We are all guilty of this, but it's okay. What we need to do now is to build **identity-based habits**. Instead of focusing on what we want to achieve (outcomes), start focusing on **who we want to become **(identity). 

 

You see, if we focus on building outcome-based habits, our old identities will most likely hinder our plans of change. It will creep up unconsciously, rendering our attempts ineffective, like poison slowly seeping through the chinks in our armor. 

 

**But when we change our identity, our habits will follow and change**, adapting to the identity we set for ourselves. 

 

The author gives us pretty good examples on how we should focus on who we want to become. 

 

>_The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. _
_The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. _
_The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician. _

Think of it as a domino effect.

 

**Poor identity leads to poor processes that in turn produces poor outcomes.**

 

Although it may be difficult to wrap our minds around, progress may also require unlearning and revision of our identity. As James Clear said, **"Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last."** Our behavior is a reflection of our identity. How we act shows the kind of person we believe we are whether we are aware of it or not. 

In the same way, internalizing an identity that isn't beneficial is also detrimental to the self. Thinking and believing that "I'm not good at mathematics or science" will not help you at all. It will condition you into thinking that there isn't a way to improve your performance on these subjects, when in reality, there is. Again, **work on your systems**.

 

## Building a Habit 

Now, let's talk about how to build a habit the right way! James Clear presents us 4 laws in building a habit and another 4 laws for breaking the habit. Our focus would be on building a habit.

### 1st Law: Make It Obvious
Ever wondered why we say something needs to be done but we never seem to make time for it and instead procrastinate? This has probably occurred to a lot of students and they end up cramming their requirements.

 
Well the truth is our actions are cue-based. The brain receives triggers from cues around us and signals us to act based from that cue.

 

When things are obvious, it's a lot easier for the brain to notice them and actually act upon it.

 

One of the ways we can do this is by **designing our environment in such a way that it makes it easier to do the thing we want to do**. Environment is one of the things that unconsciously shape our behavior.

 

Having a clean and organized workspace is more conducive to study than a messy room with stuff everywhere, is it not?

 

Flossing wasn't initially a habit for me because it took extra time and I was too lazy to do it. However, when I started putting the floss right near the toothbrushes, where I can actually **see** it, I started to develop a habit of flossing. Whenever I would brush my teeth I would see that floss "box" looking at me waiting to be used.

 

We can even take cues further and make our existing habits the cues to the new habit.

 

James Clear calls this **Habit Stacking. **The formula for this is 

 

> _After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]._

 

This enables us to chain our habits similarly to how when purchasing, one purchase leads to the other.

 

For example, I was not a reader at first and I certainly did want to implement it in my routine. So what I did was I made an internal rule for myself that, after I [take a bath], I will [read a book] for x minutes at this place and this time.

 

See what I did there? I was specific on what I wanna do, how much I wanna do it, and where I wanna do it.

 

This is what James Clear calls **implementation intent**. By having clear-cut desires and rules on your new habit, the more likely you are to do it. Most people just think that they'll try to start doing a new habit but inevitably fail because it isn't clear to them. The problem isn't motivation to do the habit, the problem is **clarity.**

 

For bad habits, we just have to invert the first law. Instead of making it obvious, **we make it invisible**.

 

If your phone or mobile gadget is out of sight, you would not be compelled to use it or endlessly scroll through Instagram or Facebook. 

 

Pretty simple right? You're less likely to do things that you can't see. There won't be strong cues to prime your brain to act.

 

### 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

Habits that are attractive increases the chance of the habit happening. It's the same for people who often fall for people on the basis of their attractiveness. 

 

Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. If you enjoy doing something you'll probably do it again and again. It eventually becomes a habit.

 

This is the reason why companies behind popular games research and formulate the best to make the game addicting, so that you can keep on feeding that dopamine-driven loop. Gaming becomes a habit because whenever you play, you feel happy.

 

Now, applying it to habits, we just have to get happiness while doing our habits. But, Jed, who finds sTuDYiNg f u n? 

 

Sometimes we may encounter stuff that we want/need to do but they don't seem to be attractive or fun. The trick here is to **reframe our perspective.**

 

But Jed, how can X Habit be attractive?

 

We can reframe the way we look at habits by **highlighting their benefits** rather than their drawbacks. 

 

Hop into google and type in "X Habit Benefits" or "Why Should I X" and you'll find dozens of reasons to do the habit. You can also lookup people who changed their lives because of a simple habit. As you'll soon find out, the habit that you're dreading is actually very attractive.

 

Before I wasn't an 8-hour sleeper. I dreaded sleeping early. I felt that I could do a lot more things in the night and that I was missing out on fun stuff. Not until I carefully examined the scientific reasons and proof that sleep is, if not, the most important thing humans need. It offers a **plethora of benefits** such as 

 
> _Living longer, enhances your memory, makes you more creative, makes you look more attractive, keeps you slim and lowers food cravings, protects you from cancer and dementia, wards of the colds and the flu, lowers your risk to heart attack and stroke. You'll feel happier, less depressed, and less anxious._ 
> _Why We Sleep - Matthew Walker_

 

After this new found knowledge, sleep became attractive to me. It promised me better learning abilities and memory consolidation which was pretty attractive and because of that I've been _pretty much_ consistent with my sleeping habits.

 

Another way to make a habit attractive is to **join a culture** where that kind of habit is celebrated.

 

You'd be more likely to read if you're in a book-reading club. You're more likely to study hard if your friends take pride in studying hard.

 

**Surround yourself with people that share the habits you want to develop**.

 

And similar to the first one we can get rid of bad habits by inverting the second law. **Make it unattractive.**

 

By **highlighting the bad stuff** of the habit, you are more likely to stop doing it. 

 

The very same reason I stopped depriving myself of sleep was that sleep deprivation demolishes our immune system, more than doubling our risk for cancer. Inadequate sleep also makes you more prone to Alzheimer's disease and Diabetes. It also hinders your ability to function well, especially since online classes are drawing near. There's many more bad stuff but, then again, you aren't here for a sleep lecture. Maybe next time!

 

### 3rd Law: Make It Easy

 

We humans are very lazy in nature and given two tasks, we would do the one that takes fewer effort to do. I mean if you think about it, in a group work, aren't you more compelled to take the easier task? 

 

For me, journalling wasn't something I initially liked. I found it very hard to flesh out words on the paper. It was very tedious and boring. But that all changed.

 

Instead of requiring myself to write tons of words, I just required myself to write a **single sentence a day**. It didn't need to have any coherence at all. What was important is it was **very easy** to do.

 

Anyone can literally do it. Yes, anyone. Yes, I'm talking to you, reader.

 

This habit eventually grew as I scaled it to 2 sentences, then later to a paragraph, and eventually to a page. And obviously, it became a habit, and I love journaling now. 

 

This was all possible because I **valued progress over perfection**.

 

Voltaire once wrote

 

> _"Perfect is the enemy of the good."_

 

If I required myself to always have a well fleshed out journal, then I probably would not have made it into a habit. If my brain was busy thinking of other stuff and its technicalities instead of focusing on just the act of writing, I would have never started. I had to tame the perfectionist in me because Voltaire said so.

 

If you can't even start, then you don't have a chance of making it a habit.

 

**Start small and be consistent then scale it**.

 

And similarly, we can get rid of bad habits by inverting the third law. **Make it difficult.**

 

By increasing the friction of those habits, you are more likely to be lazy to do it. 

 

Maybe you find yourself watching TV too often. What you can do is to remove the batteries after you watch and place the remote in someplace that is not accessible. Surely, you'll barely find time to watch TV because it's so difficult.

 

For some hardcore people, maybe you find yourself cramming too much in the night and that itself leads to another bad habit, sleep deprivation. What you can do is to set Wi-Fi limits, and beyond that limit, you'll lose internet connection. And it's pretty hard to do anything without the internet, so when you find yourself in that situation, you'll learn your lesson to not cram again.

 

### 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

 

We are likely to repeat behaviors that give us satisfying experiences. 

 

But our habits often deliver **delayed gratification**. It is the less-travelled road. But it's the **road that leads to success**.

 

I mean if you want to be successful, you must be willing to put off temporary pleasures and gratification.

 

But the question is, how do we stay on that road? How do we become consistent?

 

One practical way is to use a **habit-tracker,** whether it be manually listing it or using an app like[ Habitica](https://habitica.com/). Habitica rewards you for doing your habits with gold, equipment, pets, and more. You can also join a group of like-minded friends and beat bosses together! As you can see Habitica blends in some aspects discussed here like, attractiveness, joining a culture, and satisfaction.

 

It's pleasing to see as you make progress on your habits, this makes it satisfying and fuels your dopamine. There is a good sense of fulfilment when you see streaks of days that you do your habit.

 

"Don't break the chain" is a powerful motivation to keep on doing your habits. A sense of perfectionism awakens within us again. Missing one day would break our streak and possibly jeopardize the entirety of habit building.

 

Again, perfect is the enemy of good. Missing once it's okay. It's understandable. But missing twice? That's the start of a new habit. **So never miss twice. **

 

**Constantly reward yourself** for sticking to your habits. For me, after I've accomplished my reading and studying, I'd often watch a K-Drama. Because I want to finish the drama I watch, I make sure to always do my habits. Simple as that.

 

Another proven way to be consistent is to have an **accountability partner**, someone who will keep you in check and hold you accountable. You can even devise a contract and get punished when you don't do something. The more costly the punishment is, the more likely you won't do it again. 

 

To break bad habits, invert the fourth law yet again. **Make it unsatisfying.**

 

If you no longer are satisfied maybe smoking or playing games then there's a good chance you'll probably quit it.

## How to Stay Motivated

 

In psychology, there is what we call the Yerkes-Dodson law or the Goldilocks rule. The figure below describes it really well.

 ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201004140011.png]]

 

There is a sweet spot between difficulty (approximately 4% beyond your current ability) where-in we can reach the flow state.

 

Being in the flow is like being in the zone, being fully immersed in an activity. Being in this state allows for more breakthroughs and more work done.

 

Lastly, you'd probably get bored along the path to success because you keep on doing the same habits. As James Clear says 

 


   > _"At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self- improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom."_

 

Becoming an athlete that only performs well during fair-weather or prime conditions is not a good athlete. A good athlete performs well no matter the situation.

 

Like them, we want to be able to do the stuff we need to do, whether it be in times of inspiration or in times of boredom.

 

## Conclusion

Cultivating habits is like cultivating a plant or a tree. As you water it every day it increases in size and eventually grows into a gigantic tree.

 

The secret to success is to never stop making improvements.

 

 Fall in love with boredom and stick with your habits as they compound into something greater.

 

Don't get caught up in the fact that we have limits, but rather let's exert the effort required to get close to them and eventually surpass them.

 

Develop a repertoire of atomic habits. Set yourself up to success.
