
>Luke 11:9
>9 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

The verse tells us to just ask, and whatever we ask in His name, will be given to us. Whatever we find, we will see. And to what door we knock on, it shall be open. 

Asking repeatedly according to [[https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/11.htm|Benson]], actually means to pray repeatedly, after all the only medium of communication of us to God is through prayer. This verse encourages incessant prayer. It tells us to be very persistent when we are asking things in His name. 

God answers our prayers differently, he may give us what we exactly want, or he may give us something to equivalent to it, if not better. He may also remove thorns of flesh that hinder us from getting what we want. 

God is a God who answers prayers, be it Yes, No, or Wait. We just have to align our desires with Him and keep the faith. Whatever answer He gives is and will be beneficial to us, afterall He is an all-knowing God.
