Notes:
- It's used to prove that the Bible has been transmitted and translated accurately throughout the years. This is used against the common argument of atheists that the Bible is an old book and was modified and changed over the years.
- The more copies a manuscript it has, the less discrepancies it is likely to contain.
- There are around 25,000 partial and complete manuscripts for the New Testament
- It is one of the most reliable ancient writing known today.
- Compared to popular pieces such as the Home's Illiad (643) copies and Plato's Tetralogies (7) copies. The bible clearly overwhelming outnumbers the manuscripts of the latter.
- We also can see that the date difference between the date when the event actually happened and when the manuscript was written is very little compared to the difference in other popular manuscripts.
