### Kleitman and Richardson Cave Experiment
This experiment  sought to prove that we humans have that same clock.

Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and his research assistance Bruce Richardson went to a trip to Mammoth Cave, one of the deepest caverns on the planet. No sunlight penetrates this cave.

This discovery showed that even without sunlight, these humans showed that they would sleep and rise at approximately the same times. It also showed that our sleep cycles were not precisely twenty-four hours, it was around 24 hours and 15 minutes.
