These questions are what keep the discussion intact. They clarify whatever the members say. It is important feedback that you give that sends a signal to the sharer that you are actually listening and trying to understand what is he trying to say. These questions are also known as probe questions, whenever they give an insufficient answer or a "wrong" answer, follow up with questions. Always keep asking.
