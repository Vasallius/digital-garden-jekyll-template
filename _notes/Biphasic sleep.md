### Biphasic sleep

We humans as of now, commonly employ a monophasic type of sleep, we just sleep once at night. However, tribes before like the *Gabra* or *Sans* actually sleep in a ***biphasic pattern***. This means that these people take a 30-60 minute nap in the afternoon. 

According to [[Matthew Walker]], this is not just a cultural thing, we are actually "hardwired" to have a dip in alertness that occurs in the afternoon. This is apparently called ***post-prandial alterness dip***. 

Researchers from Harvard studied the difference between the change of sleeping lifestyle of Greek adults. Before opting out of the biphasic sleep lifestyle, everyone had no signs of diseases releated to the heart, however when the biphasic sleep lifestyle was abandoned, a whipping 37 percent increase in risk of death was recorded. This percentage is even greater for people who work.

The author concludes that, *the practice of natural biphasic sleep and a healthy diet appear to be the keys to a long sustained life*
