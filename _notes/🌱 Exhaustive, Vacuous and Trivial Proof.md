- formal proofs
	- check all of steps if valid
- informal proof
	- narrative of ideas 
	- and important steps
	- less extraneous
- which to omit?
	- after a year can you still translate the proof into a formal one?
	
### Exhaustive Proof
- examine a relatively small number of domain
- exhaust all possiblities

### Vacuous Proofs
- p ⇒ q is true when p is false

- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200928141721.png)
- means empty or mindless
	- essentially meaningless
- become basis for absurd statements

### Trivial Proofs
- p ⇒ q is true when q is already true

- easy and of little importance
- do not learn a lot from them
