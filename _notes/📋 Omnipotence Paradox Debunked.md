## omnipotence paradox
![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201020151549.png]]
- based on a simple misunderstanding
- omnipotence definition:
	- **all powerful**
	- **have power over everything else in existence**
- we encounter a problem if we use a faulty definition:
	- if we define omnipotence as the ability to do anything, 
	- should be able to do even the logically impossible 
	- however, this is a strawman argument
- 🔄: all-powerful is still limited 
	- **unlimited doesn't necessarily mean removing limits**
	- as one grows stronger:
		- their ability to relate with weaker beings becomes their limit
		- they are also limited to what they can be afraid of
		- **limits do not decrease power**
	- for the sake of a meaningful relatioship
	- **some limits are good to have and necessary to increase power**
		- bad thing to be unlimited in the maount of diseases you can be contract
			- won't make you powerful
		- unlimited problems?
	- **certain limits are good to have and necessary to be all-powerful**
- 🔄: being omnipotent and morally perfect is a contradiction
	- morality restricts you to not lie
		- but omnipotence should make you powerful enough to lie
		- however, lying won't inrcrease your power
			- can for some, but since the omni-potent being already has greater power than everything it won't increase the power
			- because lying is something that we do to get out of a problem or from people who have power over us
			- would not be put in situations that you would have to lie since you are greater than everything

- 🔄: omnipotence meaningless since we can't demonstrate omnipotence
	- we con't claim that omnipotence has been demonstrated empirically
	- our response is to show that there is no contradiction
- 🔄: but, one must be able to do stuff that is logically impossible
	- however, logically impossible things do not exist

	- **Logcal impossible things are just incoherent collection of words**

		- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201020153102.png]]
- 🔄: redefine logic
	- from a description of everything that is or everything that is possible into:
		- a boundary of rules one could escape from
	- this would mean that thie being is outside the realms og logic
	- we cannot use logic to try and debunk the existence of this being
