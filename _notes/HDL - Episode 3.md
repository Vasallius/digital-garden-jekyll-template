### HDL - Episode 3

This episode was such a blast, Ms. Jang took on so many different fancy outfits, she looked pretty in everything. This episode Chan Seong spends more time in the hotel discovering its various amenties and soon finds out about the mysterious tree. He learns that Ms. Jang is imprisoned by that tree because she has to pay back for things she did in the past? I assume it's because she killed a lot of people. In the latter part, we see a connection between Chan Seong and her, as Chan Seong is able to see the past in his dreams for some reason.

### Dialogue that struck me or resonated with me:
>Jang Man Weol: of course you were curious. Because you could only think of me.

>Thoughts:
>Yeah. Curiosity drives us to think more about a certain topic or someone. It makes us more pro-active. I wish people would be curious about God and think about Him only teehee.

>Jang Man Weol: Keep staying by my side, Ku Chan Seong.

>Thoughts:
>I think we see a vulnerable side of the angry Ms. Jang here. He asks the Chan Seong to stay by her side because of what exactly? Why do people stay by people's side? Is it because of something tangible, if so what happens when that tangible thing disappear. It's not worth it to stay by someone's side because of something that can easily vanish. Staying by someone's side is a difficult and long commitment, only done by people who have pure motives.

>Jang Man Weol: Someone told me that I'm arrogant and foolish. Although I don't agree with it.

>Thoughts:
>This resonates with me because people think im arrogant, and as Ms. Jang says, she doesn't agree with it, so do I. I don't have to listen to people who think badly of me, though criticism may be good, not all is.

>Jang Man Weol: Who said you were in third place?
>Ku Chan Seong: There were more before me?
>Jang Man Weol: You're the zeroth place. It had to be you. You completely caught my fancy.

>Thoughts:
>I have never seen anyone talk about someone being zeroth place. I gotta admit it's a fancy way of saying, "*it has been you ever since the beginning*". Zero had a bad connotation but in this sense, it's special.


>Ku Chan Seong: I'm sure you have things you miss in the old times that you cannot go back to. You were full of joy and happiness. You weren't alone like you are now. You had someone by your side. The man who taught you how to write your name, Man Weol. Is that the person you miss the most over your long stay here?

>Thoughts:
>When i think about this dialogue, I remember riane. I remember the times where we were still very close and intimate, a time period where I cannot go back to. I admit that I was indeed full of joy and happiness, but now I am alone. I have no one by my side. I hope to find someone soon teehee.

>Ku Chan Seong: After I began to see you, I think of you, very much, awfully a lot. Ms. Jang, I'm saying you are devouring on all my nights and dreams.
