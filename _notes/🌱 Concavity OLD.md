A part of the function is considered **concaved upwards** if the graph is increasing from the left side then reaches a relative max point then continues decreasing, same thing goes for **concaved downwards** but vice versa.

Another way we can determine is by the derivatives is to check if `f'(x)` is decreasing and `f''(x)` is negative. Again, vice versa for **concaved upwards**.

If `f'(a)` = 0, then the `f(a)` must be an [[ðŸŒ± Maximum and Minimum Points#Relative Local Extrema|relative minimum or maximum point]] depending on the concavity of the graph.

Algebraically, we can solve for the [[ðŸŒ± Critical Points]] of the second derivative and test points next to it to determine its concavity.
