- propositional logic can't capture membership
- cannot use express **all** or **there exists**
	- ∀ - universal quantifier
	- ∃ - existenial quantifier
- predicate - sentence containing a variable
	- becomes a statement when values are assigned to variable
- **domain of interpretation (DOI)**
	- set of all values that can be substituted
	- truth set
		- set of all values in DOI that make predicate true
	- **truth of sentence depends where you take x form**
- universal and existential statement
	- **universal: ∀xQ(x)**
		- true if every x makes Q(x) true
		- false if there is one x that makes Q(x) false	
			- called a counterexample
	- **existential: ∃xQ(x)**
		- true if there is one x that makes Q(x) true
		- false if every x makes Q(x) false
	- **have higher precedence than all logical operators**
- binary predicate - two variables
	- to express relations
	- can have different domains for each variable 
- n-ary predicate - several variables

- variable is **bound** when a quantifier is used on it
	- the part where it is applied is called the **scope**
	- name of variable linked to a quantifier is irrelevant
- variable is **free** when not bound to a quantifider
- all variables in predicate must be bound or set equal to a particular value
