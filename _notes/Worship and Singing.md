>**Psalm 47**
For the choir director: A psalm of the descendants of Korah.
1 Come, everyone! Clap your hands!
    ==Shout to God with joyful praise!==
2 For the Lord Most High is awesome.
    He is the great King of all the earth.
3 He subdues the nations before us,
    putting our enemies beneath our feet.
4 He chose the Promised Land as our inheritance,
    the proud possession of Jacob’s descendants, whom he loves. Interlude
5 God has ascended with a mighty shout.
    The Lord has ascended with trumpets blaring.
6 ==Sing praises to God, sing praises;
    sing praises to our King, sing praises!==
7 For God is the King over all the earth.
    Praise him with a psalm.
8 God reigns above the nations,
    sitting on his holy throne.
9 The rulers of the world have gathered together
    with the people of the God of Abraham.
For all the kings of the earth belong to God.
    He is highly honored everywhere.
	
>**Psalm 146**	
>1 Praise the Lord!
==Let all that I am praise the Lord.==
2     I will praise the Lord **as long as I live**.
    I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath.
3 Don’t put your confidence in powerful people;
    there is ==no help== for you there.
4 When they breathe their last, they return to the earth,
    and all their plans die with them.
5 But ==joyful== are those who have the God of Israel as their helper,
    whose hope is in the Lord their God.
6 He made heaven and earth,
    the sea, and everything in them.
    He keeps every promise forever.
7 He ==gives justice to the oppressed==
    and food to the hungry.
The Lord frees the prisoners.
>8 The Lord opens the eyes of the blind.
The Lord lifts up those who are weighed down.
    The Lord loves the godly.
9 The Lord protects the foreigners among us.
    He cares for the orphans and widows,
    but he frustrates the plans of the wicked.
10 The Lord will reign forever.
    He will be your God, O Jerusalem, throughout the generations.

>**Isaiah 6:3**
>3 They were calling out to each other,
	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven’s Armies!
    The whole earth is filled with his glory!”

What is [[Worship|worship]] to me? Is it just the songs we sing before and after church services? **But** worship is more than singing, it's something that transcends music and instruments. It's a lifestyle that we continuously choose to live, a life style that has no other goal but to please and honor God. We were created to sing, so **SING**, **SING** with all of your lungs and might. Do not conform to the music taste of this world, where everything is about sex. Choose to listen to worship songs. Turn up your worship playlist and start worshipping!
