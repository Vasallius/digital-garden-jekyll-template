## GLC: Making Sense of 2020: Kobe, Corona, and Chaos. What's going on?

- speaker: Max Jeganathan


>How do we make sense of all this chaos?

Chaos is a deeply unsettling thing. 

### How to to navigate instability?

- George Ritzer ('Mcdonaldation')
	- efficiency
	- predictability
	- calculability
	- control
- we wanna be in control
	- plan everything
- showed us that we don't really have control
- instability is really part of our lives
-  "if we hold on to things in this world and base our identity on it, those things are vulnerable, our identity will be vulnerable too"
	- jobs
	- friends
	- investments
	- social media
	- it doesn't take much to bring them down
	- our world can't bear the burden of our identity
	- we need to find an anchor outside of the system
- anchor in Jesus Christ , transcendent
- Jesus has already overcome the storm

### How to rethink independence?
- we correlate dependence with weakness or strrugle
- but in reality we are actually depending on something
- when we say we are "emotionally" or "financially" independent, we are depending on the idea of independence
- Loki - " the natural posture of the human race is a posture of submission and worship " #quote 
> What are we dependent on something?
- " we are infinitely dependent so we need something/someone that is infinitely dependable " #quote 

### How to deal with suffering

There are two realities that plague creation, my insufficiency to the world and the world's insufficiency to me.

"Suffering is meaningless" - atheism
everything is meaningless since we just have to construct meaning - atheism

**people are looking for comfort and strength to get through suffering
people are looking for hope beyond the suffering**

our worldviews tell us to navigate around suffering and to avoid it

Jesus becomes a person and experiences the same suffering, he takes all of our suffering and brokenness and goes to the cross, dies to conquer the suffering.

John 10:10

He came and suffered for us, and now He's willing to suffer with us.

some people don't realize that they are lost

Kobe, Corona, or whatever it may be. Jesus Christ is the solution

Prince Caspian vs White witch
- all we need is Aslan
- Aslan will get here when we get here

God is ultimately in control, but in the mean time, we should be pouring our love practically. #quote 

Spanish flu if they lived 400% more if they lived near a Christian.

Why would God give us independence when we're gonna be dependent anyway.

freedom and flourishing are linked through purpose

“I have on my table a violin string. It is free to move in any direction I like. If I twist one end, it responds; it is free. But it is not free to sing. So I take it and fix it into my violin. I bind it and when it is bound, it is free for the first time to sing.” - Rabindranath Tagore #quote
