#### Statements
- A statement (or proposition) is a sentence which is either true or false but not both.

#### Connectives
- negation `~` or `¬`
	- false when statement is true
	- true when statement is false
- conjunction `∧`
	- p ∧ q = `p and q`
	- **only true when both is true**
- disjunction `∨`
	- p ∨ q = `p or q`
	- **true when either is true**
	- false when both is false
	- inclusive
- exclusive or `⊕`
	- english OR
	- **only one can be true**
		- either p is true or either q is true
- conditional `→`
	- read as if p then q
	- p implies q
	- q is true on the condition p is true, order matters
	- p - hypothesis/antecedent/premise
	- q - conclusion/consequence
	- **only false when q is false and p is true**
	- look up *vacuous and trivial truths*
	- converse
		- q → p
	- contrapositive
		- ¬ q → ¬ p
	- inverse
		- ¬ p → ¬ q
	- conclusion:
		- implication and contrapositive same truth values
		- converse and inverse same truth values

- biconditional `⇔`
	- p is necessary and sufficient for q
	- if and only if
	- p implies q and q implies p
	- implication and converse both true
	- **only true if same truth values of p and q**
