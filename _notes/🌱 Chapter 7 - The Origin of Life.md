- **p. 120 The complexity of the living cell**
	- Michael Denton
	 - ![[Pasted image 279.png]]
	 	- basic design of cell system is essentially the same in all living systems on earth from bacteria to mammals
	 	- size, structure, and component design of protein synthetic machinery is practically the same in all cells
			- ![[Pasted image 278.png]]
		- there is slightest empirical hint of an evolutionary sequence among all the diverse cells on earth
	- supported by Nobel Prize Winner *Jacques Monod*


- **p. 121 Irreducible Complexity**
	- tiny acid-driven motor of flagellum is irreducibly complex
		- it won't work without its parts being complete - complete loss of function
	- modifying existing functions would not be able to produce an irreducibly complex system
	- ![[Pasted image 280.png]]
	- *Cavalier-Smith* also concedes that no detaield biochemical models exists
	- existence of irreducible complexity cannot also be explained
	- different theories on the origin of life
		- *replicator first*
			- tackled in his Book, **The Selfish Gene**
			- there was this **Replicator** cell that can produce copies of itself (unlikely)
		- *metabolism first*

- p. 124 **The building blocks of life**
	- organisms are made by proteins which are made out of builiding blocks known as amino acids
		- **How did it arise?**
	- Russian biochemist *A.I. Oparin* suugested that primeval Earth before consisted of methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapour
		- life has arisen with aid of radiation from the sun or external sources such as lightning
			- performed this experiment
			- this produced a **2 percent yield of amino acids**
			- further experiments have produced all **except one amino acid necessary for life**
		- geochemists believe that the primeval earth had a different composition #verify
			- instead, it contained nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour 
			- there were also loads of free oyxgen
				- would inhibit formation of crucial biomolecules


- **p. 126 The major problem: the origin of protein structure**
	- proteins are not just a product of combination of amino acids when injected energy needed for their construction
		- very complex
	- ![[Pasted image 281.png]]
	- **blind chance won't just arrange amino acids into proteins**
	- probability of getting the 100 amino acids in the correct order is `(1/20)^100`
	- ![[Pasted image 282.png]]

- **p. 127 Self-organization scenarios**
	- Nobel Laureate *Ilya Prigonine and Isabelle Stengers* argue that order and organization can arise from disorder
		- ![[Pasted image 283.png]]
		- butterfly effect
		- Rayleigh-Benard convection
		- Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction

- **p. 130 The core problem**
	- *Paul Davies*
		- ![[Pasted image 284.png]]
	- **How did the self-replicating organisms arise in the first place?**
