>Just because you have a meeting, doesn't mean you are a movement.

Kuya Dan told us that in a movement if we meet once or twice or weekly or whatever frequency that may be, if you don't produce leaders and multiply, you are not a movement, you only have a meeting.

This reminds of Pace Academy Growth Group, are we merely a meeting or are we a movement?

The members attending the group should not just be the core members or our close friends, we must reach out to other people and expand the souls we are reaching.

In the movement there must be three key elements present.

- [[ðŸŒ± Not leader-centered]]
- [[ðŸŒ± Develop Leaders]]
- [[ðŸŒ± Reach out to others]]
