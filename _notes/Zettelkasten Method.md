> “Why do we take notes in the first place?”


See: [[Why we take notes]]

The author mentions that he stopped taking notes when he reached college. He previously believed that note-taking was for retention but if that was the case, we could use better methods such as [[Spaced Repetition]] and [[Method of Loci]]. The author also mentions that he used Anki[^1]  for note-taking.

[^1]:Anki is a free and open-source flashcard program that utilizes spaced repetition.

>“What really is the point of note-taking?”
Many excellent authors take notes, but they takes notes differently. They do not merely copy information, they take notes with a goal of developing ideas.

This led the author to realize that note-taking wasn't a waste of time. We are supposed to take notes that would last a life time. Many excellent authors take notes, but they takes notes differently. They do not merely copy information, they take notes with a goal of developing ideas. 

See: [[Goal of note-taking]]

**The point of note-taking is to think better.**

See: [[How to think better]]

Conventional note-taking does not allow us to freely explore subjects of interests, it hinders us as notes are often categorized under folders or topics that we set beforehand. 

### Keeping Up with Information Overload
>The problem Bush was addressing, or the problem of the individual researcher, was one of system topology. The poor person has successively narrowed and narrowed his or her field of interest in order to cope with the information overload, and soon is connected only to things of very local interest. The topology clearly doesn’t work, because there is no path for the transfer of knowledge from one discipline and the next.
>*Berners-Lee*

When we only focus on one part of the specialization, we can't seem to connect with the other ideas in that field. This picture illustrates this visually. This is the problem with rigid categorization. 

 See:  [[Problem of rigid structures]]

>In providing a system for manipulating this sort of information, the hope would be to allow a pool of information to develop which could grow and evolve with the organisation and the projects it describes. For this to be possible, the method of storage must not place its own restraints on the information. This is why a “web” of notes with links (like references) between them is far more useful than a fixed hierarchical system.
>*Berners-lee*

Back then, the author mentions that Vannevar Bush envisioned a system like this and he called it memex[^2]. It would be ideal if we organize our notes like a memex, research would be easier as we would have access to information we already know. And to no surprise, this method is called the [[Zettelkasten Method]].

[^2]: A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.


### Zettelkasten Method Overview

The word *zettelkasten* is a German word for "slip-box". [[Niklas Luhmann]] used this to become an extremely productive scholar publishing over  70 books and 500 articles in 30 years.

Luhmann used notecards for note-taking. He also used links to organize his notes and show connection between them. There were no categories and hierarchies emerged as he made more notes, instead of being established from the beginning. Instead of doing it top-bottom, he did it bottom-top. The author gives an example to illustrate this. He also mentions that notes can be part of multiple hierarchies. This allowed him to generate ideas.

>If you had the notes “cat”, “dog”, “duck”, “mouse” — a new hierarchy would emerge to organize them, called “animals”. “Animals” didn’t exist at first. Heck, it wasn’t even predetermined. But because you recognized the meaning lurking in those four notes, that higher-level hierarchy emerged. ==Put simply, topics would come from the patterns you recognize from your notes==.

See: [[How Luhmann took notes]]
### Why Use The Zettelkasten Method
Berners-Lee thought that if any piece of information was deemed important, it only needs a place to be found and a way of finding it. We can think of the Zettelkasten as our second brain. It doesn't just store notes, it generates future notes that generate future ideas. We might be able to organize notes using tags, or can we?

### Why using tags alone is impractical
Tagging may help us categorize our notes to some extent, but in turn we have to remember the tags, and this becomes hard to manage when your note collection grows. This is why it is more practical to use links instead as remembering multiple tags and knowing what combination of tags to put on your notes can lead to [[Decision Fatigue]].

See: [[Why using tags aren't enough]]

### Why using search alone is impractical
We might argue that we can just search the keywords using the search function. But what if you have multiple notes tagged with that keyword, you would have to go through each one of them just to find the note you are looking for. That's just too tiring and inefficient. Also, we might encounter a problem where when our knowledge grows, we think of the tags differently, thus we can't really remember the tags we initially created, let alone find the notes we need. We still use search, but we don't use it to that extent.

See: [[Why using search alone isn't enough]]


### General Principles of the Zettelkasten Method
- Linking
	- See: [[Zettelkasten Principle - Linking]]
	- > Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. That is why we need a note-taking system that is as comprehensive as GTD, but one that is suitable for the open-ended process of writing, learning and thinking. […] The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.
		>*Sonke Ahrens*
	- Links allow us to find a note regardless of position.
	- The author mentions how he tried to develop [[Folgezettel]] into the digital environment but fails. However he mentions that it is for a better use. namely taking notes out of books.
	- It's not recommended to just link a big note to another note.

- Atomic Zettels
	- Zettels should only contains one idea per note.
	- See [[Zettelkasten Principle - Atomicity]]
	- See [[Principle of Atomicity]]. (further research)

- Decentralization
	- See: [[Zettelkasten Principle - Decentralized]]
	- The author gives an example on how to illustrate emergent property
		- Connections between people with the same values and interests form friendships; Connections between friendships with same interests can form interest groups
		- Connections between cells working toward the same physiological function form an organ, and connections between organs can form biological systems

- Future-proof
	- Notes must be future-proof, it's kinda useless if they are only for short-term use.
	- The digital nature of zettelkasten softwares make it possible for our notes to be future-proof.
	- See [[Principle of Least Power]].
	- The author quotes Berners-Lee
		- > Computer Science in the 1960s to 80s spent a lot of effort making languages which were as powerful as possible. Nowadays we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most powerful solution but the least powerful. ==The reason for this is that the less powerful the language, the more you can do with the data stored in that language.== If you write it in a simple declarative from, anyone can write a program to analyze it in many ways.
	- Zettelkasten notes use the same concept. we employ notes using the markdown (.md) format.
	- You can use scripts to visualize your notes, you can migrate to a different program without much work, and more importantly, plain-text documents are here to stay.
	- See: [[Zettelkasten Principle - Future-proof]]

### Tools for the Zettelkasten Method
There are three necesarry tools to employ the Zettelkasten method.

See: [[Tools for the Zettelkasten Method]].

Note on the quest to find the "best Zettelkasten tool":

>Cognitive tools only offload our cognition, but they don’t have the ability to know, think, and understand. They do extend our cognitive capabilities, but we still do the thinking. (Dror & Harnad, 2008)

It doesn't have to contain all functions that you need, just follow the principles of Zettelkasten. 

### The Workflow: How to Use the Zettelkasten Method
1. Capture:
	- Contains two parts, namely reading and taking literature notes.
	- >Reading is a lot like catching a ball; the content you’re reading are sort of a series of “idea balls” thrown not only through space, but also through time. Obviously, the writer’s job is to throw his ideas and the reader’s job is to catch them. The moment you get what the writer is trying to say, is the moment you can jot them down in your own words.
	- When reading, search for main premises and arguments. You can even capture a whole paragraph to take note of the essence. You can always elaborate and make a zettel later on.
	- You can highlight and take notes at the same time, so that you get both the source material and your insights.
	- >Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. All you have to do is to have a pen in your hand while you are doing what you are doing anyway (or a keyboard under your fingers).
		>*Sonke Ahrens*
	- That said, merely “capturing” information shouldn’t be the goal — making information yours is more important. That brings me to the next step.

2. Elaborate
	- This step is when you turn the notes you have gathered into individual zettels. This is when you know you fully understood the thing you were reading. Only then can you use it as your own.
	- This can be done with a brief logical explanation or analogy. Keep in mind the [[Principle of Atomicity]].	
	-  Zettels are also called evergreen notes.
	-  Make what you learned atomic and explicit.

3. Make fleeting notes explicit ASAP
	- Temporary notes must be turned into explicity notes, because they'll probably slip your mind.
	- Anken says:
	- >Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.

4. Use UID’s to add identity to Zettels
 	- This allows us to change anything from the Zettel and not damage anything.

5. Summarize contents in the Zettel title
	- Summarizing contents make future linking easy.
	- Usually a one sentence
	- Example:
		- >Specialization uses a tree topology. Since tree topologies increase the gap between disciplines through branching, it creates similar problems to hierarchical, non-hyperlink file systems mentioned by Tim Berners-Lee: you have to start from the top of the tree when you need something from a farther branch. (See: Tree structure creates navigation problems) This limits multidisciplinary progress.
	- Sample titles:
		- Specialization’s tree topology increased gap and limits multidisciplinary progress
		- Tree topology from specialization limits multidisciplinary progress
		- Topology of specialization limited multidisciplinary progress

6. Write as if you’re writing for others
	- **We’re not wired to write notes that our future selves can understand.**
	- The truth is, we’re simply biased to feel overconfident about our memory, that’s all. (Kornell & Bjork, 2009)
	- To overcome this ego, it's better to think of writing others, your future self might also be considered as "other people". This allows notes to be usable in the future.

Example:
![[Pasted image 44.png]]

7. Connect
	- Give context to the link you linked.
	- ![[Pasted image 45.png]]

8. Link from existing notes
	- Linking new notes to old notes, make it hard to find.

9. Creating structure in your Zettelkasten
	 - Create structure notes. Doing this makes u make sense of your notes
	 - ![[Pasted image 46.png]]
	 - One must not capture just the literal thought trails themselves, but also the meaning.



Summary:
1. When you can recall a related note, link from it immediately; otherwise,
2. Find potentially related structure notes. We’ll talk more about structure and hierarchy later, but if there aren’t any of these, skip to step 5.
3. Decide if:
- The new note falls directly in that structure note; or
- The new note is related to a note within it. (could be both)
4. When a higher-level insight emerges, (i.e. you decode a higher-level insight from the notes you connected) create a structure note.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you’ve exhausted your options.
6. Click on tags and find some potential relations.
7. Do a full search for related keywords.
8. Go back to step 4.
