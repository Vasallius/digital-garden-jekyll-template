### HDL - Episode 1

This is the first time I'm gonna watch a Kdrama where in IU is in it. I must say that she is very pretty and her tone of voice is very to my liking. It's also such eyecandy that she dresses up multiple times in the first episode. 

At the latter part of the episode IU changes the way the guy sees the world, he now sees the dead. My insight from this is that, maybe we need to see the world differently as well, and I hope IU is the one that opens my eyes teehee.

1. It's so true that IU really looks to pretty to be scared of, as for me i've fallen in love üòç

2. After getting stabbed by the guy she shot, IU gives the guy a chance to run away, but he doesn't and instead brings back a cart to help carry IU.

3. This world is filled with prideful people who will most likely not be willing to take the blame or take consequences for the things they do. Their first instinct is to blame other people.
