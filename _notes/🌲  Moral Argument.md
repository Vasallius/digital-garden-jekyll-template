## moral argument
 ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201005103809.png]]
- Can you can be good without believing in God ?
	- Yes.
	- **but the question is can you be good without God?**
- If God does not exist, **objectives moral values do not exist**
	- Why?
		- no objective reference point
		- we can't say what is really up or down
	- Thus,
		- God's nature serves as the objective reference point for moral values
		- It is the standard upon which everything is measured
	

## subjective morality
- If we go with subjective morality,
		- we're left with one person's view point which is no more valid than anyone else's viewpoint
		- who's to say what viewpoint we take?
- **preference in subject not in object**
	- doesn't apply to other people
	- applies only to the subject
	- **not valid for anyone else**
- Without God, {No evil and no good, nothing but blind and pitiless indifference} - Richard Dawkins [[🗯 Quotes, Questions, and  Aphorisms]]

## moral duties
- God's commands as basis
- Example:
	- God's essential attribute is love
	- love your neighbor as yourself
	- these serve as a foundation to which we base our moral values
	- generosity, sacrifice, and equality 
	- greed, abuse, and discrimination

## answering the euthypro dilemma
- Question: is something God because God wills it or does God will something because it is good?
	- see: [[🌲  Euthypro Dilemma]]
- Answer: **God wills it because He is good**
	- analogy:
		- the more closely a recording sounds like the concert, the better it is
		- the more closer an action conforms to God's nature, the better it is
- if atheism is true,
	- no standard, and as such, **no moral obligation**
	- who/what lays duties upon us?
- Good and bad, right and wrong, do exist.
	- we know this because,
		- our physical experience of the physical world is real
		- our moral experience points show that moral values are objectively real
		- you affirm your belief in the existence of moral values when you fight with someone with opposing moral values as you
	- **is something that's wrong only a personal preference of an opinion?**
	- > The man who says that it is morally acceptable to rape little children is just as mitaken as the man who says 2+2 = 5
	> Michael Ruse #quote [[🗯 Quotes, Questions, and  Aphorisms]]
- **atheism fails to provide a foundation upon where to base our moral values**
