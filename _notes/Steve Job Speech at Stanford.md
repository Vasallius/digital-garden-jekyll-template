It is my honor to be to give a speech to you all
- Connecting the dots
	- drop out
	- adopted
	- took calligraphy classes that later was used in the Mac
	- impossible to connect the dots, you can't connect the dots looking backward
	- trust that the dots will connect sometime in the future
	- follow your heart

- Love and loss
	- fired from a company he started
	- "i still loved what i did"
	-  "been rejected but still in love"
	-  "getting fired from apple was the best thing that has ever happened in my life" 
	-  'dont lose faith'
	-  'you've gotta find what you love'
	-  =='keep looking dont settle'==

- Death
	- what is truly important
	- ==Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. ==
	- ==Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.==
