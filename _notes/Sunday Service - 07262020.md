Knowing the Lord is the only antidote that can overcome the problem of fear, worry, and anxiety/ #quote

#### Know God No Fear

##### Personal encounter
- v.1 
	- Whom shall I fear?
	- Whom shall I dread?
	- see Psalm 36:9
		- in the light of God, we see light
	- see 2 Corinthians 4:3-4
		- the reason why  people cannot understand is because Satan has blinded their minds
	- see John 8:12
		- Jesus is the light, if we follow Him, we won't walk in darkness.
		- without Jesus, we are in darkness, we cannot comprehend the truth
		- what do you base your judgment and decision making? is it human opinion? books you read? media?
	- The lord is my **salvation**.
	- see John 17:3
	- see John 10:28
	- To overcome fear, you have to know who God is. #quote	
	- The Lord is our **security**.
	- Without a personal relationship with Jesus, how do you overcome fear?

- v.2-3
	- How did David overcome fear amidst the war and his enemies?
		- because of his personal relationship with God
		
##### Pursue intimacy
- v.4
	- He asked **one** thing: dwell on the House of the Lord 
		- i want to be in the presence of God
		- We people pursue many things
			- money
			- position
			- relationship
			- fame
			- family
			- happiness
		- these things are good, except when they have more importance than God
		- idolatry won't make us experience God
		- "Many of us seek happiness but you cannot find happiness apart from seeking God first" #quote 
	- "You can work for your boss for many years and still not know him/her"
	- "You can be with somebody but if that person doesn't open up, you won't know them"
	- God was willing to reveal Himself
	- the myth of no time
		- to spend time worshipping God
		- study the BIble
	- not because you don't have enough time, it is because it's not important enough
	- make the choice David made
	- prioritize the life-long pursuit of knowing God
	- What is worship?
		- Our proper response to who God is, what he has done for us, and what he continues to do

##### Pray expectantly

- v. 7-8
	- The more you know God, the more you like to pray

	- see James 4:8
	- The only thing that would prevent us from developing intimacy with God is sin. #quote 
- v. 9-10
	- prayer is an attitude of dependence
	- God may allow problems to help us draw closer to Him
	- human relationships are fragile, even our parents can forsake us, but God won't
- v. 11-12
	- his prayer life was changed and influenced by his situation of being in danger
	- see Proverbs 14:12
		- story on someone cheating, excuse: "God wants me to be happy"
		- to be happy without God is an impossibility #quote 
			- it's like oil and water
	- **Are you knowing the Lord?**
	- **Are you pursuing intimacy with Him?**
	- see Psalm 119:105
- v. 13-14
