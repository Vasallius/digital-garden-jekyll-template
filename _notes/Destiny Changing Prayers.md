### Destiny Changing Prayers

#### Scripture
[[Genesis]]32:22-31

>**Jacob Wrestles with God**
22 During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two servant wives, and his eleven sons and crossed the Jabbok River with them. 23 After taking them to the other side, he sent over all his possessions.
24 This left Jacob all alone in the camp, and a man came and wrestled with him until the dawn began to break. 25 When the man saw that he would not win the match, he touched Jacob’s hip and wrenched it out of its socket. 26 Then the man said, “Let me go, for the dawn is breaking!”
But Jacob said, “**I will not let you go unless you bless me.**”
27 “What is your name?” the man asked.
He replied, “Jacob.”
28 “Your name will no longer be Jacob,” the man told him. “From now on you will be called Israel, because you have fought with God and with men and have won.”
29 “Please tell me your name,” Jacob said.
“Why do you want to know my name?” the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there.
30 Jacob named the place Peniel (which means “face of God”), for he said, “I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared.” 31 The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel, and he was limping because of the injury to his hip.


#### Observation

>❓ What was at the heart of Jacob’s cry in his wrestling with the man (v.26)?

Jacob wanted to be blessed a lot. The insight that we can get from this bible story is that God can change people no matter who you are. Jacob was a liar and a deceiver yet overnight he became Israel. Through Israel, other nations of the world would hear the Word of God.

#### Application

>❓ How will I commit to pray for the nations, given that our all-powerful God can change people’s destinies in answer to our prayers?

Given what is happening right now, there's more conviction that God changes people that will change nations. There is nothing that God can't do. I commit to pray for the Philippines especially with our problematic government.

#### Prayer

Lord, I pray that you change the seated government officials and heal our land from COVID-19 Oh Lord. I also pray that you bless me a lot. Lord thank you that I am able to wake up yet another day again. Lord I pray for forgiveness yesterday for shouting and quarelling over sunday service. I also pray for Adrienne and whatever he's going through right now. Amen.
