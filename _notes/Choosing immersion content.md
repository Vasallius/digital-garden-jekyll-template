### Choosing immersion content

Choose content that was made by Korean people for Korean people. Try to avoid stuff that has been simplified to beginners, you have to train your brain to parse real speech. Watch stuff that you actually enjoy, don't focus on understanding since, nothing would be pretty much comprehensible.

Some stuff I recommend you to watch:
- Youtube videos
- K-dramas
- Movies
- Re-watch stuff you have watched with english subtitles before

Whether to watch with subtitles or not, see: [[Should i use subtitles]]
