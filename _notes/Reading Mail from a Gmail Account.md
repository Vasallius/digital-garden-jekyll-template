Gmail organizes emails that are replies to each other into conversation threads. When you log in to Gmail in your web browser or through an app, youâ€™re really looking at email threads rather than individual emails (even if the thread has only one email in it).

EZGmail has **GmailThread** and **GmailMessage** objects to represent conversation threads and individual emails, respectively. A GmailThread object has a messages attribute that holds a list of GmailMessage objects. The `unread()` function returns a list of GmailThread objects for all unread emails, which can then be passed to `ezgmail.summary()` to print a summary of the conversation threads in that list:

1. To view unread messages.
``` py
unreadThreads = ezgmail.unread() # List of GmailThread objects.
ezgmail.summary(unreadThreads)
```

2. Each thread has a list of messages (replies), in the case of a no-reply email, the messages list would only contain one value, thus only accessible by index 0.
``` py
str(unreadThreads[0].messages[0])
```
3. Each message on the message list thave different values we can access.

``` py
unreadThreads[0].messages[0].subject
unreadThreads[0].messages[0].body
unreadThreads[0].messages[0].timestamp
unreadThreads[0].messages[0].sender	
unreadThreads[0].messages[0].recipient
```
