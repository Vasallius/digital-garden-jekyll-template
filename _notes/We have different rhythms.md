### We have different rhythms

Some people tend to be more active in the day (***morning larks***), and some in the night (***night owls***). These are mostly related to your genetics. 

In our time, morning larks are often favored as almost society revolves around  waking up early, such as going to work or going to school. This forces the half-awake night owl to function with less efficiency. It's not that they don't like to sleep, they just find a hard time sleeping at night.
