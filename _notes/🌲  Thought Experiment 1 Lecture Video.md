 ## on skepticism
- a certainable knowledge is **impossible** both global or local
- local skepticism posits that I can doubt everything in **my** experience
- global skepticism posts that I can doubt everything in and outside of my experience in **others too**
- The Evil Demon, similar to the [[ðŸŒ² Problem of Skepticism#evil genius|Evil Genius thought experiment.]]
	- If something like that exists, can there anything be beyond doubt?
	- Can the Evil Demon possibly be ourselves?
	- âœ¨ thinking thing = **res cogitans**

 ## arguments for skepticism
- âœ¨ **relativism**
	- denial of objectivism, thus they claim that there are no objective truths
	- it depends on **what** you are talking about
	- no statement can ever be possibly true
		- examples
		-  it's raining today
			-  depends where and what time you said it
		- lying is wrong
			- depends on situations that would possibly merit it
		- even mathematical rules
			- even axiomatic principles may be different in different worlds
- âœ¨ **subjectivism**
	- it depends on the person speaking **(who)**
	- depends on one's own understanding of the world
		- this is personal and may not be true to all people
- âœ¨ **perspectivism**
	- depends on **which** perspective you are coming from
	- infinite number of vantage points
	- all truths are subject to interpretations and has bias
- All lead to the same conclusion: 
	- **âˆ´ there is no absolute, unquestionable truth**

## arguments against skepticism

- **doubting is beyond doubt**
- **act of thinking necessitates a thinker	**
- **deception requires a deceiver and a deceived fellow**
- **âˆ´ there is an absolute truth**
- âœ¨ *cogito ergo sum*
	-  **"I think, therefore I am"**
	-  see: [[ðŸŒ² Brain in a Vat]]

## problems with the cartesian cogito

- **existence becomes a function of thinking**
	- existence comes after thinking but doesn't thinking only occur on beings that exist?
	- Descartes claims that "I am" doesn't really mean existence, but by begining to be aware of consciousness
		- when a person starts to think he becomes aware so as to exist
	- **thinking is only a key feature of existence**
		- not a precursor for existence
- **solipsism is inescapable**
	- the only existence provable is the **thinker's existence** or **I**
	- solipsism 
		-  only knowledge about the self is provable and knowable, anything beyond that is not since you do not have access to other people's minds
- **existence is fleeting without fixed rules**
	- **do we stop to exist when we dream or sleep?**
		- the moment the thinking stops, the I ceases to exist
		- but, that clearly isn't the case
	- existence seems to be an "on-off" switch and we don't know when it switches 
- **becomes a set-up for the God argument**
	- assumes that there is a Good God that won't allow the thinker to be deceived forever
	- God's perfection is proof that He exists
	- this is unknowable
