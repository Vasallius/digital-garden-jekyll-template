Nowadays, we can future-proof our notes with software, and as we age we will be able to communicate with the Zettelkasten and our ideas won't ever be lost. Due to this nature as well, we are using a simple type of file, [[markdown files]]. It is also useless if we just write notes for the short-term, to future-proof it means it will last for a very very long time, aiding us in whatever study we may want to conduct.
