### Progressing in Realistic Discipleship

### Scripture
[[Mark 8]]:14-21, 22-26, 27-33

>**Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod**
14 But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat. 15 As they were crossing the lake, Jesus warned them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod.”
16 At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn’t brought any bread. 17 Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, “Why are you arguing about having no bread? Don’t you know or understand even yet? Are your hearts too hard to take it in? 18 ‘You have eyes—can’t you see? You have ears—can’t you hear?’[a] Don’t you remember anything at all? 19 When I fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward?”
“Twelve,” they said.
20 “And when I fed the 4,000 with seven loaves, how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up?”
“Seven,” they said.
21 “Don’t you understand yet?” he asked them.
>**Jesus Heals a Blind Man**
22 When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged him to touch the man and heal him. 23 Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then, spitting on the man’s eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked, “Can you see anything now?”
24 The man looked around. “Yes,” he said, “I see people, but I can’t see them very clearly. They look like trees walking around.”
25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again, and his eyes were opened. His sight was completely restored, and he could see everything clearly. 26 Jesus sent him away, saying, “Don’t go back into the village on your way home.”
Peter’s Declaration about Jesus
27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”
28 “Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”
29 Then he asked them, “But who do you say I am?”
Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.[b]”
30 But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
**Jesus Predicts His Death**
31 Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man[c] must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but three days later he would rise from the dead. 32 As he talked about this openly with his disciples, Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things.[d]
33 Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples, then reprimanded Peter. “Get away from me, Satan!” he said. “You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God’s.”

#### Observation

>❓ What is the significance of Mark arranging the stories in verses 14 to 21 and 22 to 26 before the story in verses 27 to 29?

>Discipleship is a key theme in Mark's Gospel.
*Edmund Chan*

As we can see, the disciples have witnessed Jesus perform many miracles, and they went from questioning who Jesus is to affirming that He is the [[Messiah]]. After this however, Peter got [[Divine Must in Discipleship|rebuked]]. We can see that Jesus did not give up on his disciples and as D-group leaders, we should not as well. 

>Realistic biblical discipleship is a three steps forward, two steps back journey. But two steps back is not the end of our discipleship story. Biblical discipleship is redemptive discipleship.
>*Edmund Chan*


#### Application

>❓ How do I respond to the two steps back in my discipleship journey?

Well, whenever we fall short of doing discipleship, like I am right now, we must remember that, this is not the end of the journey, there are countless times that we can improve and refine the way we disciple people. It's also  wake up call not go give up on our members.

#### Prayer

Lord, I pray for the leaders in the CCF community to not lose heart and hope whenever they experience setbacks in the discipleship journey. Lord, I also pray for forgiveness for I have committed the same sin again ): Lord, give me energy and enthusiasm as I complete whatever I have to complete today. Amen.
