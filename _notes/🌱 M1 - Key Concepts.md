- A Computer is an electronic device that can perform activities that involve Mathematical,
Logical and graphical manipulations.
- Three operations
	- receive data and instructions from input device
	- process the received data 
	- output a result
- Data : It is the collection of raw facts, figures & symbols
- Information : It is the data that is processed & presented in an organized manner
- Program : Set of instructions that enables a computer to perform a given task.

	- CPU 
		- brain of the computer
		- carries out instructions
		- Memory Unit
			- primary storage of main memory
			- stores instructions and results
			- sent to the output device
			- consists of thousands of cells called storage location
				- activate using binary (0,1)
				- bits used to store data
		- Arimethic and Logical Unit (ALU)
			- all arithmetic operations and evaluation of logical functions are performed
			- receives the data that needs to be processed from the memory unit
		- Control Unit
			- central nervous system
			- ensures program flow is followed
			- coordinates with input and output devices in the system
- **Memory of a Computer**
	- three criteria
	- access time - time required to locate and retrieve stored data as a response to instructions
	- storage capacity - how much data can be stored
	- cost per bit of storage
	- units of memory
		- basic unit of memory is a bit (binary digit)
		- characters require 8 bits (1 byte)
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20376.png)
	- conversion
		- ASCII
		- characters have corresponding codes that can be converted to binary
	- RAM
		- read/write memory as information
		- stores instructions for programs and data
		- data is only in RAM when computer is running, disappears when computer is turned off
		- volatile
	- ROM
		- read-only memory, cannot write
		- built-in memory of a computer
		- stores only basic input - output instructions
		- permanent
		- non-volatile
- **Hardware and Software**
	- Hardware
		- physical components of a computer
		- things we can touch
	- Software
		- program or set of instructions
		- without the software, hardware won't function
- **Categories**
	- Operating System
		- software that manages the resources of the computer
		- interface between user and hardware
	- Translators
		- computers only understand machine language, as such programs must be translated first
		- software that translates is called a translator
		- two types of translator
			- compilers
				- checks if program is error free
				- produces the entire program in machine language
				- translation before execution
			- interpreters
				- translates and executes one line at a time
			- differences
				- error corrections is easier in interpreters, error list is only produced after the entire program (compiler)
				- interpreter takes more time for execution as it is translated one line at a time
	- **Programming Languages**
		- Machine Language
			- language in terms of binary
		- Assembly Language
			- uses mnemonic codes rather than numeric codes
			- machine dependent
		- High-Level Language
			- referred to as Problem-Oriented Language
			- convenient for writing programs
				- english like language
			- machine independent
				- can be ran on any computer
