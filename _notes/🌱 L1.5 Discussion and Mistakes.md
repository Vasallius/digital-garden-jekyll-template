See that there is an absolute value function here, I should have checked for one-sided limits. I initially answered 4, when it should have been DNE

Should have just applied the theorem that the limit of $\frac{sin x}{x}$ = 1. Then I would substitute âˆž to get 0.

The denominator can be changed into *sin t* by expanding *cos(A-B)*

Use the sum identities and transform the numerator.

Be careful of saying the function is instantly polynomial, prove that the function is continuous at the end points
