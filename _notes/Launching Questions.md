These are questions that get the discussion going. You can usually start with how was your week or how was your day. This is make everyone be a little bit comfortable talking, especially the shy ones.

Sometimes people answer this question very minimally or what i call 'tipid'. They would say "it's fine" or "it's okay". A minimal probe gets them to actually tell you.  Example would be, "Why is it fine?", "How fine?", "Gaano ka okay?", "From a scale of 1 to 10, how okay? and why?" These questions help in making the members tell you how their week went.
