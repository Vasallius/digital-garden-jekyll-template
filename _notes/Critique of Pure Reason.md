### Critique of Pure Reason Summary

What is the nature of space and time? 
Is the world governed by the law of cause and effect – and if so, why? 

- Before they build a metaphysical system, philosophers must assess the origin and nature of our minds’ mental materials.
	- Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that tries to elevate our knowledge of the world into the loftiest realms of human inquiry.
	- But if it’s “not very far,” then we should stay closer to the earth – contenting ourselves with the more mundane knowledge of the sciences, while leaving the more esoteric stuff to religion.
	- My take: Basically understand the limitations of the mental materials of our mind/brain, unless you want to blindly build a metaphysical system that will fail you at the very least


- To avoid the danger of metaphysical dogmatism, philosophers must conduct a critique of pure reason.
	- Among other things, philosophy is about submitting our beliefs to critical scrutiny.
	- Thus, to avoid dogmatism, we must submit our capacity for pure reason to critical scrutiny. Is it capable of granting us metaphysical knowledge? If so, how and to what extent?
	- My take: We are committing dogmatism when we assume that our mental materials can build metaphysical systems

- By failing to avoid the danger of dogmatism, philosophy encourages the spread of skepticism.
	- If it’s attainable, metaphysical knowledge could only be accessed through pure reason.

- Both religion and science depend on metaphysical concepts, making skepticism a danger to both of them. 
	- We’ll never see God in a telescope, a soul in a microscope, or any other metaphysical entity by any other means of empirical observation. But if reason can’t know anything about them either, all such beliefs would be unsupported and unsupportable.
	- Our notion of causality is itself a metaphysical concept.
	- The Scottish philosopher David Hume made a point that greatly influenced Kant’s thinking. It goes like this: if we just focus on the evidence provided by our senses, all we see are various things that happen in conjunction with each other. First you turn on the stove. Then the water boils. If you observe this happening many times, you can say that one thing tends to follow another, which establishes a pattern describing those events.

- If reason cannot provide us with a priori knowledge, then it cannot secure our knowledge of mathematics either. 
	- If we say we know something a priori, that’s a fancy Latin way of saying we know it’s true independently of our experience. For instance, consider the equation 7 + 5 = 12. This simple bit of arithmetic is an example of a priori knowledge. But to understand why, we’re going to need to unpack it a bit.
	- As a rule, then, we can say that if we know something is necessarily and universally true, our knowledge cannot derive from experience.

- A priori knowledge isn’t innate knowledge; it’s knowledge that the mind produces through its own internal mechanisms.
	- If it’s possible for us to gain metaphysical knowledge, it couldn’t be empirical knowledge derived from experience. It would have to be a priori knowledge derived from reason. So now we’re looking for a way of gaining that.

- The mind can be divided into three main faculties – sensibility, understanding, and reason.

- To organize sense data into meaningful information, the mind needs predefined ways of structuring them.
	- It’s the idea that the mind isn’t just a passive recipient of sense data, as if it were a blank slate. Instead, it plays an active role in shaping that data into meaningful information about the world.
	- And thus, to be able to perceive any object as being in any spatial position or relationship whatsoever, the mind must already have a framework of space to put it in, prior to encountering the object.

- Time and space are pure forms of sensibility, which provide the mind with templates for organizing sense data.

- Our minds also contain templates for understanding and reasoning about the world.
	- Our minds have been equipped with the very simplest of reasoning such as X is Y, if X then Y, and many other logical statements that help us form connections in this world

- The mind can use its templates to acquire a priori knowledge and concepts.
	- We don't need any experience to form a priori concepts.

- As far as we can know, the categories of understanding only reflect our experience of reality, not reality in itself.
	- In other words, causality is something your mind constructs; it’s something your mind inserts into its experience of reality. It’s your mind’s way of understanding the world. Things just don’t make sense to it until it’s put them into some sort of causal order.
	- We can thus say with certainty that reality really does exhibit a law of causality – but only insofar as we experience it. As for reality in itself, that we cannot say.

- We cannot know anything about reality in itself – even whether it exists in space and time.

- Reason should not venture into metaphysical speculation about the nature of reality in itself.
	- After all, we can only know reality insofar as we experience it.

**The human mind plays an active role in shaping its own experience and understanding of reality. To play that role, it needs templates for structuring sense data, concepts, and judgments into a coherent picture of the world. Because these templates are internal to the mind, and because we can never perceive or understand reality without them, we cannot know if they reflect the nature of reality as it exists in itself, independently of our minds. This leaves open the possibility that reality in itself is very different than our experience of it. It also makes metaphysical theories of that reality a matter of pure speculation. We should therefore stick to scientifically understanding the empirical realm, while leaving the metaphysical realm to religion.**
