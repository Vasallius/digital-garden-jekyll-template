Good morning! So I just wanna share some insights on what I've read. So in **Zechariah 9:9**, it was foretold that the King would be riding on a donkey's colt and indeed this happened in **John 12:15**. People with palm branches were shouting Praise God (NLT) or Behold the King! (ESV). So Jesus is a King, in fact the King of Kings, but on closer inspection, have you ever heard of a king that has been tortured, humiliated, and even worse crucified? Jesus was such a different kind of King, he was humble and was willing to endure so much pain for our sins despite being the King of Kings. Pero guess what, he died on the cross and after three days rose again, he basically beat death and rose to life, **what other King would you want to serve?**

Lastly, in **John 19,** Pilate was asking the people why they would crucify their King, and the people responded, "We have no king but Caesar."

So ito lang tandaan niyo, in a secular world where their king is no other than Caesar, make Jesus your King. King over everything. Yes everything.
