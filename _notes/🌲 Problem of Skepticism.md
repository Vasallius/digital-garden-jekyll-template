## consider the following questions
- What do you know for sure?
- Is this something you know?
- How do you know that you know something for sure?
- Do you doubt that you have knowledge?


## two types of skepticism
- âœ¨ **academic skepticism**
	- sensory experiences don't actually enable you to know anything 
	- impressions are misleading
		- ex: how do u know that the same mouse you are using is the one that you've been using everyday
		- you may be mistaken, hallucinating, misremembering, or external factors could have been at play
	- **conclusion: knowledge is impossible**
- âœ¨ **pyrrhonian skepticism**
	- doubt everything without conclusions
	- is knowledge even possible?
	- who knows that knowledge is possible/impossible?

## global skepticism

This kind of skepticism doubts everything.

### dreaming argument
- if what you are experiencing now is just a dream then you do not know anything about your immediate environment or even about yourself
- Xiang Xiu [Jwang Ju]
	- dreamed about being a butterfly
	- worried that he did not know whether:
		- he was a man dreaming he was a butterfly 
		-  he was a butterfly dreaming he was a man
- can you know some facts whether or not you are dreaming?
	- Rene Descartes answers:
	- even when you are dreaming, you can still know that the square has four sides or that 2 + 3 = 5
	- however, we conclude this because this feels natural to us
		-  but, does what feel natural to us be really true?
		-  where does our nature come from?
		
### evil genius
-  there is an evil genius who
	-  is extremely cunning and powerful
	-  controls your sensory impressions and all your instincts
	-  makes false things seem true to you
	-  how can you prove that right now you are not in the hands of the evil genius?
-  Descartes addresses his own thought experiment here: [[ðŸŒ²  Three Responses to Skepticism#cartesian way|Cartesian Way]]

### brain in a vat
- related note: [[ðŸŒ² Brain in a Vat]]
-  can you prove that you are not a brain in a vat?
-  typical skeptics don't try to prove that you are actually in a brain in a vat
	-  it's bad enough that you just might be
	-  good case vs bad case
	-  if you are in the good case
		-  you are lucky
		-  but you can't prove you're not in the bad case
	
				
 ## local skepticism
- worries about some specific facts and particular range of knowledge
- raise some situations where something could have gone wrong
	- knowledge of the past
	- clock example
- the possiblity of error
	- make it seem like knowledge is hard to obtain
	- do we always ahve to double check
