### Different types of listening immersion

There are three types of listening immersion as mentioned in this [video.](https://youtu.be/SSWabajK1Sc)

1. Active listening 
	- giving 100% undivided attention
	- trying your hardest to understand it
3. Passive listening
	- doing something else while listening
1. Background listening
	- audio playing in the background
	- actively ignoring it while reading a book or sleeping

Listening to the music of your target language may be beneficial, but not as beneficial to actually listening to actual spoken Korean language.
