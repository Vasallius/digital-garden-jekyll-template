>What's the point of having a God whom you don't have a relationship with?

In material terms, what's the point of having expensive stuff if you don't even want to use it? The quote goes deeper on the necessity of having a relationship with God, not only just knowing Him. We are to seek the God we claim to know, because if we don't we just ran afoul of our knowledge.
