### Humans at the top of evolution's lofty pyramid

BOTTOMLINE: **REM-sleep dreaming led to our astonishingly rapid evolutionary rise to power, for better and worse-a new (sleep-fueled), globally dominant social superclass**.

As mentioned [[Transition to ground sleep|here]], humans have now acquired the much coveted REM sleep and this is precisely why we have become one of the leaders in the social structure of living beings.

Directly quoting from [[Matthew Walker]], he says 
>REM sleep increases our ability to recognize and therefore successfully navigate the kaleidoscope of socioemotional signals that are abundant in human culture, such as overt and overt facial expressions, major and minor bodily gestures, and even mass group behavior.

So basically, REM sleep has enabled us to make better decisions and actions and better handle our emotions as well.

[[Matthew Walker]] further adds that,
>These intra and interpersonal processes has forged types of cooperative alliances that are necessary to establish large social groups, and beyond groups, entire societies brimming withp powerful structures and ideologies.

It seems far fetched but REM sleep helped us facilitate the way we interact with ourselves, and with other people and from that, mighty and well-organized societies blossomed with people having various ideologies.

As mentioned [[Sleep Cycle|here]], REM sleep helps in facilitating memory, specifically long-term memory. They take whatever newly gained information and relate them to whatever is already stored.

**REM-sleep dreaming therefore represents a tenable new contributing factor, among others, that led to our astonishingly rapid evolutionary rise to power, for better and worse-a new (sleep-fueled), globally dominant social superclass**.
