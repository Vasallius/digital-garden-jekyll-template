## intro
- also known as **Divine Command Theory**
	- God dictates morality
- Main question:  **Does God say things because they are good or are things good because God says they are good?**

## first horn: God says things because they are good
- **God's omnipotence seems limited**
- there are other reasons why things are "good"
- God doesn't define good, he just tells it to us
- God would not be able to do everything
	- because He is constrained by rules of morality
	- if He is constrained by morality
		- He would be powerless to disobey whatever the rules of morality required of him
- **God is not required for morality**
	- morality would continue to exist


## second horn: things are good because God says it
- Morality is arbitrary
	- God being the arbiter
- God making everyone to suffer?
	 - if God demanded yearly murder of 100 children
	- still considered good even if we think it's bad
	- because of this:
		- **God's omnibenevolence seems compromised**
- cannot be judged as "good"
	- because he can't be otherwise
- **no morality if God stops existing**
- no deep reason for morality
	- it's good because of one reason: God said it
