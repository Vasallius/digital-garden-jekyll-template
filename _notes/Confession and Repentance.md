> 'But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness. '
*1 John 1:9*

God promises us to forgive us whenever we sin as long as we confess to him. We are naturally wicked people but God is a forgiving God.

> 'Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results. '
*James 5:16*

In this verse are asked to **confess our sins to each other**, it may be our friends, family, or dgroup leaders. The latter part of the verse says that prayer itself of righteous people has great power and produces wonderful results. There is a promise when brethren continuously pray for one another, it has the power to help people resist temptations and whatever trial they may face.

This verse really speaks a lot. God has been very forgiving and full of grace and mercy even if we commit sins in day to day basis. We must not take forgiveness for granted and even more a license to sin. His grace and loving kindness should compel us to turn away from our wrong doings.
