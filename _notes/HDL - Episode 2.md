### HDL - Episode 2

This episode Ku Chan Seong still tries to not work for Ms. Jang Man Weol but eventually finds it very hard to work for his hotel since he can still see ghosts and the like. They free the Baekdu Tiger in exchange for the ludicrous Mt. Baekdu painting. A touching part of this episode was when Mr. No, the manager who has worked for Ms. Jang for 30 years will be replaced. Actually, he died and it's a pity Ms. Jang won't see him in the afterlife because Ms. Jang cannot die.
