>To the average person, this might be the case. But, when you believe and fully put your faith in a God who is sovereign and who has masterfully created plans for your life. Then, in confusion, there is clarity.


>Jang Man Weol: Can't you just comfort me even if you don't mean it? The least you could say is, "Would you like me to buy you a yacht?"
