### 1. Is philosophy useful? If it is useful, what do people get from philosophic contemplation? 

As reflected in the film, what do you think is the value of philosophy in Neo's life and those of the members of the group of Morpheus?

- Philosophic contemplation allows one to be able to think about stuff more deeply and challenge pre-existing beliefs about reality. Contemplation helps people to not lose their sense of [[ðŸŒ²  Top Hat Lecture Video|wonder]]. As seen in the movie, because of philosophy, Neo's life has changed dramatically. To the members of Morpheus' group, they were freed from **The Matrix**.

### 2. Why does philosophy bank on uncertainty?

How does the uncertainty of the real world affect the way Morpheus and his group lived their lives?

- Uncertainty undoubtedly was a driving force for people to seek the truth and allowed them to question the reality of things. This has changed their lives as they have realized that what they were feeling and seeing was not the real world, it was just a designed world.

### 3. Compare and contrast philosophers and practical men. Who are the philosophical characters and practical men in the film?
- Practical men are already comfortable with the life they have even if it wasn't real. In the movie, this was demonstrated by the character of Cypher who regretted that he chose the red pill instead of the blue pill. People like Cypher was tired of knowing the reality and wanted to become practical by living in an imaginary world being an actor with a lot of money. As said by Bertrand Russel in [[Attachments/The Value of Philosophy.pdf|The Value of Philosophy]], practical men only reconizes materials needs and is oblivious to the needs of the mind.

### 4. Are philosophers successful in providing definite answers to their questions? Why are questions more important than answers according to Bertrand Russell?
- Philosophers are definitely not successful most of the time in providing answers. Seeking answers to questions give birth to even more questions to answer. As mentioned by [[Attachments/The Value of Philosophy.pdf|Russell]], when an answer becomes definite, it becomes part of the sciences. This means that none of the answers provided by philosophy are demonstrably true.

### 5. What is the tyranny of custom? Is it hard to veer away from this tyranny? Take note of what Neo felt after discovering he was living a lie all his life. 

- The tyranny of custom is the feeling of certainty in our everyday lives. It is very hard to veer away as we have been living like this and are preconditioned by the world and external factors to think that we must accept things as very certain. This brought birth into dogmas and beliefs that are otherwise unquestioned. In the movie, Neo could not believe it in the first place, after all how can you comprehend that everything was just a lie?

### 6. What is philosophic contemplation? What is the role of philosophy in liberating man from the tyranny of custom?

- Again, as mentioned by [[Attachments/The Value of Philosophy.pdf|Russel]], it is the **unalloyed desire for truth**. It allows man to escape dogma and discover a universe that is magnificent. Only til then, will he be liberated from the chains that he set for himself.
