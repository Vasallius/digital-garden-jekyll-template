>*Psalm 13:1-2*
>1 How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever?
    How long will you hide your face from me?
2 How long must I wrestle with my thoughts
    and day after day have sorrow in my heart?
    How long will my enemy triumph over me?
	
Psalm 13 shows us that David was waiting on God, very desperately. To be able to wait for someone so desperately means that you trust that someone so much that you will wait for Him. 

Around September onwards, I broke my phone and thus when I would meet up with people, communication would be very hard. But, whenever I arrive first at a destination, i wait for them, because i trust that they will come.

In times of dryness, we thank that God is far-away but that isn't the [[ðŸ—¯ Where is God when you need Him|case]]. God has, is, and always will be there, he just calls us to wait. God has His own perfect timing, all we need to do is to trust.
