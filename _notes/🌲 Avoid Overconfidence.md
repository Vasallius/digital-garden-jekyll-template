In focused-mode, there is a tendency to be very overconfident and to miss a few mistakes here and there. This feeds our left hemisphere. This hemisphere is also the hemisphere that tries to cling to the way things are. Often we are encouraged to step back and recheck what we do. It takes lesser minutes to check than to solve. It also helps to [[ğŸŒ² Brainstorm with Others]].

Richard Feynman also says that we must not fool ourselves even if the easiest person to fool is ourselves.
