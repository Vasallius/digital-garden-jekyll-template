### Day 8 - Mark 7

---

- Pharisees were adding to the laws
	- they were not speaking God's word, they were speaking their Word
	- Jesus call them hypocrites
	- they were far from Jesus
- it isn't what comes in that defiles you, it's what comes out of your thoughts, emotions,and actions.
	- Jesus declared the foods clean already
	- we don't need to obey the leviticus rules
	- be clean!
