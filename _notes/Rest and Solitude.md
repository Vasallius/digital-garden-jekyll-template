13“Keep the Sabbath day holy.
**Don’t pursue your own interests** on that day,
but enjoy the Sabbath
and speak of it with delight as the Lord’s holy day.
Honor the Sabbath in everything you do on that day,
and don’t follow your own desires or talk idly.

The Sabbath day is the Lord's day. The verse explicitly says to **not pursue our own interests**. Then what then shall we do during the Sabbath? We are supposed to draw near to God, and seek Him, afterall it is His day. This day is not supopsed to be like any other day. This is the day where we delight in His presence, bathe in His glory, and proclaim His name.

Jesus had a different rhythm. He modeled purposeful work and holy rest. The Bible shows Jesus actively working with miracles and preaching, but he often withdrewed to pray and rest. Holy rest is **MORE** than the absence of work. It is intentional, God-centered, and it delights us in the Lord. If we can to keep the Sabbath day holy, we need to think about things that draw us closer to God.
