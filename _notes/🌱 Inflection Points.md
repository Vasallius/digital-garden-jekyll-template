**Graphically**: 
- These are points of transition wherein the graph changes from concave upwards to concave downwards or viceversa. 
-  The slope goes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa. 

**First Derivative**:
- [[ðŸŒ± Maximum and Minimum Points|Maximum or Minimum point]] of the first derivative

**Second Derivative:**
- Point where `f''(x)` = 0 and **crosses it**. It's **not enough to touch it**.
- `f''(x)` goes from negative to positive or vice versa
