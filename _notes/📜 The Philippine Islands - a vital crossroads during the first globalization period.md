# The Philippine Islands - a vital crossroads during the first globalization period

## Abstract
- Globalization
	- system of exchanges of every kind (human, economic, cultural)
- Philippine Islands were a vital crossroad in this process
	- Firstly, the islands acted as a major distributor of Mexican silver in the Pacific sphere.
	- Secondly, they were Spain’s launching pad for access to neighbouring kingdoms (China, Japan, the countries of Southeast Asia, the Spice Islands), with which it was connected by means of trade, missionary activities, diplomacy and sometimes war.
	- Lastly, the Philippine Islands were connected directly to the mother country following the opening of the Cape of Good Hope route by various ships, dispatched first by the Navy, then by private trading companies and lastly, by the Royal Company of the Philippines. The Seville (or Cádiz)-Veracruz-Mexico City-Acapulco-Manila axis, with movement in both directions, served as a permanent route for the exchange of precious metals and exotic products.
	

## Intro
- ***Key Dates***
	- **the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus (1492)**
		- forge connection between Europe and an unknown continent which was explored latter
	- **Vasco de Gama’s arrival in India (1498)**
		- second marked the arrival point for a lengthy exploration, first of the western coast of Africa and then its eastern coast, before finally landing in India
	- **the discovery of the South Sea by Vasco Núñez de Balboa (1513)**
		- possibility of crossing America and from its western coast, embarking on journeys of exploration both northward and southward
		- possibility of venturing across a vast ocean, eventually revleaing different islands that lead to Asian Far East
	- **the circumnavigation of the world by the fleet which set off under the command of Ferdinand Magellan and completed its voyage under Juan Sebastián Elcano (1522)**
		- established interconnections
	- And so the most immediate consequences of the explorations undertaken during this thirty-year period would be the *creation of a network of intercontinental exchanges*, the *discovery of the existence of many worlds*, the paradoxical *emergence of a single world* for the first time and the possibility, also for the first time, of *conceiving of a universal history.*
	- **Portuguese route**
		- laced Lisbon at the European end of an axis of communications which ran along tehe African coast, reached India and continued on to its Asian terminus, defined by the Chinese coasts and the arc of islands extending from Japan to Indonesia, with the Philippine Islands at the centre.
	- **Spanish Route**
		- positioned Seville (and later Cádiz) at the European end of another axis which linked Spain with both Veracruz and the Atlantic ports of Panama. From there, it continued across the American continent either via the Isthmus of Panama to the port of El Callao in Peru, or along the old route of the viceroys to Mexico City and then along the “Asia Route” to the port of Acapulco. From there it crossed the Pacific Ocean, the “Spanish Lake”, to the Philippine Islands, where it converged with the Portuguese route
## The Spanish in the Philippines
- House of Trade (Casa de la Contratacion) would run the system of trade (Indies Route) for 3 centuries
	- encompassed a network of several American ports
		- Veracruz, which supplied the Viceroyalty of Mexico
		- New Spain; those that supplied the Viceroyalty of Peru
		- Nombre de Dios (later replaced by Portobelo)
		- Cartagena de Indias on the Atlantic
		- Panama and El Callao on the Pacific, which were reached via the isthmus
		- Havana, on the island of Cuba, where the two fleets – one to New Spain and one to Tierra Firme and Peru – converged en route back to Seville
- **1513 Discovery of South Sea led to:**
- Access to Moluccas
	- legendary Spice Islands
	- became private preserve of Protuguese trade after Spain relinquished any possible claim to the islands (Treaty of Zaragoza, 1529)
- permanent presece on the Philippines Islansd
	- can serve as a solid base between America and Asia
- attempted to discover the mythical Terra Australis
- **1565 Miguel López de Legazpi**
	- took possession of the successive islands in the archipelago he visited: Ibabao, Samar, Leyte, Limasawa, Camiguin, Bohol, Mindanao, Siquijor, Negros and, finally, Cebu
	- in Cebu:
		- founded the first Spanish settlement, Villa de San Miguel.
	- granted the title of adelantado to conquer and govern the “Islands of the Thieves” ( Mariana Islands)
	- proceeded to occupy Panay, Masbate, and Mindoro
		- rescued Chinese slaves
	- then journeyed towards Luzon
	- in Luzon:
		- Taking advantage of dissension among the three Muslim rulers (Sulayman, Matanda and Lakandula), he obtained concessions for land in the area of the Pasig River, around a magnificent natural port.
		- He officially founded the city of Manila there on July 24th, 1571, enacting the by-laws of its council and making it the capital of the Philippines
- The only areas that would remain outside their jurisdiction were part of the territory of Mindanao and the most distant archipelago, Jolo or Sulu, which would continue to be an independent territory in the hands of various Muslim sovereigns
## Mexican Silver in the Fareast
- Thus, the Philippine capital of Manila became on one hand, the setting-off point for making a number of contacts with neighbouring countries.
- On the other hand, Manila was also the terminus of the great trans-Pacific trade route known as the Manila Galleon or “Nao de China”. This route linked the Philippine Islands and the Viceroyalty of New Spain for more than two centuries
- Traffic between the Philippines and Mexico began in 1565 with the sailing of the galleon San Pedro, captained by Felipe de Salcedo, with Augustinian friar Andrés de Urdaneta as its chief pilot and a crew of two hundred men.
	- made port in Acapulco
	- from then on would serve as the American end of the Manila Galleon route
- In the final years of th 16th century, there was an alternative route
	- ships sailing from the Philippine capital to the Peruvian port of El Callao, the Nicaraguan port of Realejo and the port at Huatulco on the Mexican coast
	- Spaniards soon banned Tierra Firme and Peru
- Trade in Manila was primarily controlled by Chinese merchants (commonly known as Sangleyes)
	- whose junks brought foodstuffs to the Philippine capital (wheat and barley, sugar and fresh and dried fruit, especially grapes and oranges), but especially­ manufactured goods from throughout the Eastern world.
- Deals were made in an open market known as the Parián de los Sangleyes, where Spanish merchants who were permanent residents of the Philippines came to negotiate prices and quotas for goods to be sent to Acapulco
	- conducted and regulated by a system known as pancada
	- overtime, trading would escape the control of the pancada
