### Who do we say Jesus is

>We can be blessed by God, cared for by God and helped by God; but in the final analysis, we do not know who God really is.

This was the case in [[Mark|Mark 8:27-29]]. Even when Jesus has performed miracles already and even if Jesus has already lived among us. Most of the people, specially those who just listen to Him as he preaches, do not really know who He is.
