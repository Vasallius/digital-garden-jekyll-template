- latency: the time it takes for a message to transfer
- networks first appeared 1650s and 1960s
- ability to share resources
	- printer
	- storage drives
- **Local Area Networks (LAN)**
	- Ethernet (1970s)
	- connected using ethernet cable
	- **Unique Media Access Control**
		- MAC Address
		- to know whether the information was for them
		- placed in the header
		- every computer has a unique MAC Address
	- approach called as Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
		- copper wire -> carrier (ethernet)
		- air -> carrier (wifi)
- **Bandwith**
	- the rate at which a carrier can transmit data
	- draw back:
		- if network traffic is heavy
		- collision might happen
			- data gets all garbled up
		- computers can detect these collisions by listening to the signal on the wire
	- solution ?:
		- stop transmitting
		- however the same computers will do the same
		- wait until carrier is silent then wait to jump in
		- causes more collisions
- **Ethernet Fix**
	- wait for a brief period before they retransmit
	- different wait durations
		- 1.3 seconds and 1.5 seconds wait time
	- extra trick:
		- wait 2 seconds when it collides again
			- 4, 8 , 16 , and so on
		- called as the **exponential backoff**
- **Collision Domain**
	- the number of devices on any given shared carrier
	- can break into 2 domains usings a **Network Switch**

- **Routing**
	- **Circuit Switching** - switching whole circuits to route traffic to the correct destination
		- inflexible and expensive
	- if you have dedicated lines, you don't have to share
		- can be used to full capacity
	- **Message Switching**
		- instead of dedicated route from A to B, messages are passed through several stops
		- can use different routes]
		- fault-tolerant
		- the number of hops a message takes along a route is called the **hop count**
			- keeping track is useful to identiy routing problems
			- message might be passed endlessly between two cities
			- waste of bandwith
			- high hop counts â‡’ something gone wrong
			- **hop limit**
		- messages sometimes big
			- solution:
			- chop into **packets** (Packet Switching)
				- might arrive in different order
				- can be decentralized
- IP Address
	- every computer connected to a network has one
	- **congestion control**
		- balance the load
- Different Protocols
	- TCP/IP
	- ICMP
	- BGP
- Arpanet
	- world's first packet-switched network
