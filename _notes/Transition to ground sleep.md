### Transition to ground sleep

BOTTOMLINE: **Our transition to ground sleep allowed us to get more quality REM sleep.**

Sleep also differentiates us humans and makes us special. We sleep less than them but have the proportion of sleep we spend in REM sleep is far greater (20-25%) compared to only 9%. 

Before, the early species of humans slept on top of trees, this seemed very intuitive as being high in the air gave some sort of protection from other animals. But at the same time, this markedly constrained their sleep.

But eventually, they would transition to sleep at land because of fire. According to [[Matthew Walker]], 
>Fire was one of the most important catalysts-if not the most important-that enabled us to come out of the trees and live on terra firma.

Because of this transition, our sleep became more concentrated and finally we can now consume "body-immobilized" REM sleep. We no longer need to be "half-asleep", trying to balance on a branch of a tree.
