	- carrer opportunities
	- marketability and profitability of the degree program
	- impact on society and service orientation
	- progressiveness of field and community involvement
	- production of goods
- how does philosophy stand in relation to these standards?
	- unfair criteria for Philosophy because they came from practical men
	- better to listen from actual philosophers
		
 ## ordinary conception of philosophy
 - Philosophy is ordinarily conceived as a discipline without value. Why?
 - **No knowledge if possible in the matters it is concerned with**
	 - matters philosophy are concerned with:
		- metaphysical
		- reality
		- God
		- death 
		- time
 - **There is a misconception of the kinds of goods it seeks and the ends of life**
	- conerned with feeding the mind, not the body
		- most essential pursuit of life:
			- truth 
			- wisdom 
			- understanding
			- meaning
	- you can't understand purpose without deep thinking and contemplation
 - **It is thought to attempt to answer pointless questions**
	- "pointless" questions actually broaden the mind
	- allow independent thinking and intellectual autonomy
	- questions are more important than answers
	
	
## physical science vs philosophy
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201015163544.png]]
- physical sciences
	- results-oriented
	- have tangible products
	- have **direct effect** on the lives of those who study it and other people
- philosophy
	- process-oriented
	- have no tangible products
	- have an **indirect effect** on the lives of those who study it and other people
- products of philosophy are underappreciated by the masses
	- theories
	- perspectives
	- not enjoyed and used by everyone
- indirect effect
	- only affects people who study it
	- intellectual virtues
		- wisdom
		- intellectual humility
		- open-mindedness or openness to possibilities
		- critical and creative thinking
		- intellectual autonomy
		- reasonableness
	- hardly recognizable
		- when you possess virtues, you naturally think you do not have it
		- a truly wise man, will not claim that he is
			- Socrates: "the only thing i know is that i dont know anything"

## practical men vs philosophers
- **practical men**
	- instinctive men
	- they recognize material needs
	- they strive for the goods of the body or bodily pleasres
- **philosophers**
	- rational or intelelctual men
	- they recognize the need to feed the mind
	- they strive for the goods of the mind of intellectual pleasures
- different things to strive for
	- the need to have wisdom and knowledge
- **ignorance is bliss**
	- cypher (practical man)
	- happiness and bodily needs is what matters
- **to deny our own impulses is to deny what makes us human**
	- mouse (half-practical and half-philosopher)
- morpheus is the best example of a philosopher
	- **free your mind**
	- **i can only show you the door, you have to walk through it**
	- **matrix is a prison for the mind, you are a slave**
	- **think you are know you are**
	- **real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain**
- spoon boy
	- **do not try to bend the spoon, it's impossible**
	- **only try to realize the truth that there is no spoon, it is you that bends**
- key to getting liberated is to free one's mind
	- recognize we are in chains
	- recognize that we are being manipulated by the system
	- break free from the chains of habit
- trinity
	- **is it the question that drives us, it is the question that brought you here**
- oracle
	- **being the one is like being in love**
	- "temet nosce"
		- know thy self
- philosophy is being in love, with wisdom

## function of uncertainty
- why is uncertaint important in philosophizing?
	- **it fuels our curiosity and drives us to ask more and more questions**
	- **as soon as definite knowledge becomes possible, philosophy ceases to be itself. It becomes a separate science. Philosophy deals with residual or left-over questions**
	- **with certainty, the act of wonderment dies out. The highest of knowledge for Socrates is to know one self - To know that you do not know anything at all**
- driving force, fuel of contemplation
- when definite answers are provided to questions
	- they become different fields of sciences
- "residual" questions
	- questions in another disciplines that they do not ask
- when man starts to know
	- prejudices
	- dogmatic assurance
- socratic irony

## the function of answers
- **The answers philosophers provide are not ascertainanbly true. They are neither falsifiable nor verifiable.**
- **Separate science emerges when questions have been answered.**
- **Philosophic contemplation is a continuous effort.**
- philosophers can provide answers but are not provably true
	- neither falsifiable nor verifiable
- sample theories
- plato's theory of worlds 
	- matter and forms
	- forms = basis
- john ross' theory of justice
	- imagine yourself in an original position behind a veil of ignorance
	- u know nothing of yourself and natural abilities and position in societies
	- jusitce is fairness
	- each is entitled to things in a fair manner

## philosophic contemplation
- philosophizing unshackes us from the tyranny of custom
- Russell = **tyranny of custom**
- Gaarder = **habituation**
- custom is tyrannical, we are the slave
- customs includes prejudices, traditions, dogmas, ill-founded belief systems
- custom enslaves us
- personification of habit
	- involuntary (russell)
	- voluntary (gaardner)

## the aim of philosophy
- Knowledge or wisdom is the union of the Self and the not-Self. It is the kind that gives unity and system to the sciences and that which results from a critical examination of our consciousness, prejudices, and beliefs.
- The Self is the **subject or the Knower**, while the not-self is the **object or the universe or world around us**
- The union is best attained through a kind of philosophizing that is not anthropocentric or egocentric but **biocentric**.
- ‚ú® **ecocentrism**
	- **man is the measure**
	- any idea that does not fir the scheme of the self is rejected right away
	- egocentric
- ‚ú® **biocentric**
	- **man is not the measure**
	- and idea that does not fit the scheme of the sefl ie mbraced
	- belief is fluid and open as reason demands

## the value of philosophy
- indirect effects of it upon the lives of those who study it
- goods of the mind that it seeks
- greatness of the objects it contemplates
- liberating capacity which opens us up to vast possibilities and **frees us from dogmatic assurance and thinking**


Philosophy is love.

We love for the sake of loving.

Philosophy is a combination of agape and philein.
