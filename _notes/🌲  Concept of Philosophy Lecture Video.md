## problem of defining philosophy
- to define is to enclose a concept within limits
	- âœ¨ define - **definere** (to limit)
- hard to define philosophy, we would **limit** and **box** it
	- something that could not be done
- philosophy talks about **anything** and **everything** 

## anatomy of a definition
- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200922162039.png)
	- âœ¨ **definiendum** - term to be defined
		- term is not a concept of the term itself
		- because the concept cannot be made out of letters alone
		- term is only used to refer to its corresponding concept
	- âœ¨ **sense** - word or label for concepts 
	- âœ¨ **reference** - concept it refers to 
	- âœ¨ **genus** - category
	-  âœ¨ **differentia**/**intension** - what distinguishes is from other genus:
	  	- substantial, but insufficient
	  	- essential quality
	- âœ¨ **denotata**/**extension** - kind of things that are members of the genius: 
	- âœ¨ **definiens** - genus + differentia
	
## trying to define philosophy
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201022191913.png]]
- 3 possible definiens
	- ** thinking activity of reflection or analysis**
		- other fields also do the same
		- random and illogical debating?
		- random monologue?
	- **set of values and principles one lives by**
		- any kind of theorizing and valuation?
		- any thought, a philosophical thought?
	- **consists of basic understanding of reality and the world**
		- any understanding is philosophical?
			- baseless and unfounded ones?
- is it an art? a science? a social science?
	- all? none? or any of these?
- **defining philosophy is a complicated task and a philosophical problem of its own**
	- term does not have a one-to-one correpondence
	- to define is to limit
- **best approach to understand philosophy is to experience it**
