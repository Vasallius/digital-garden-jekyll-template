- **What are philosophers really for?**
	- In greek:
		- Philo = love
		- Sophia = wisdom
	- Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom
		- being wise means being able to live and die well
	- 5 characteristics of normal people
		- don't ask big questions
			- what is the meaning of life?
			- what's a job for?
			- how should society be arranged?
			- philosophers: **unafraid of asking big questions**
				- these questions can be broken down
		- vulnerable to common sense
			- common sense = stuff you take in without thinking about it
				- often full of daftness^[informal terms for insanity. craziness, flakiness. insanity - relatively permanent disorder of the mind.] and error
			- **subject common sense to reason**
			- is it really true what people say about different aspects of life?
			- is an idea logical vs it must be right because it's popular and long-established
		- mentally confused
			- we're not good at knowing what goes on in our own minds
			- lack insights into our own satisfaction and dislikes
			- **philosophy is committed to self knowledge**
				- know yoursef - Socrates
		- muddled ideas about what makes us happy
			- we're not very good at making ourselves happy
			- we make wrong choices because of advertising and false glamour
			- we overestimate and underestimate things
				- happiness a material thing gives us vs what a simple walk can contribute
			- **philosophers seek to be wise by getting more precise about the activities and attitudes that really can help our lives to go better**
		- panic and lose perspective
			- **philosophers know what really matters and what doesn't**
			- Zeno on hearing the news that he'd lost all his possessions in a shipwreck:
				- "Fortune commands me ot be a less encumbered philosopher"
			- philosophical is a byword^[a word or expression summarizing a thing's characteristics or a person's principles] for calm, long-term thinking and strength-of-mind
			- philosophy then and now
				- modern times, philosophy is delivered in books
				- ancient times, philosophers discussed in market squares
				- philosophy was normal and basic, not unusual or esoteric
	- when the value of philosophy becomes clearer, we would be meeting more philosophers in daily life
	- the points at which our unwisdom bites and messes up our lives are multiple and urgently need attention

ðŸ’¡ Summary:

Philosophers are people who love wisdom. They want to live meaningful lives. They have characteristics that separate them from normal people. They ask big questions that people are afraid to ask. They don't know just readily accept common sense, they also subject that to reason. They also seek to understand ourselves deeply. They also would want to know what really can help us improve our day to day lives. Lastly, they know what matters and what doesn't.

- What is the Value of Philosophy?
	-  no value 
		-  waste of time in pursuit of useless questions
	-  dangerous
		-  it corrupts the youth with obscure ideas, shatters certainties with misplaced doubts.
- To Russel, philosophy is mostly about **pursing unanswerable questions** and **shattering common sense certainties**
	- the very value of philosophy lies in these grand questions
	- philosophical uncertainities **clear the way for a greater sense of wonder**
	- philosophy may not provide food for our bodies It **certainly nourishes our minds**
- Philosophy doesn't have the utility practical sciences have, but the kind of knowledge it is after, "**gives unity and system to the body of sciences**"
- Philosophy pursues questions with no answer on the horizon, but like Newton's great work "Mathematical principles of natural philosophy" many subjects once studied in philosophy now belong to sciences.
	- The study of heavens, once philosophy, is now subject of astronomy.
	- The study of the mind now belongs to psychology.
- But indeed philosophy continues to ask the difficult questions.
	- Questions such as "Has the universe any unity of plan or purpose, or is it a fortuitous concourse of atoms?"
	- Or "Are good and evil of importance to the universe or only to man ?"
	- These questions may never be fully answered
-	Asking difficult questions **enlarges our thought to the whole outer world**
	- Such enlargement **fees us from the prison of private interests** and lets us **embrace what is beyond our self confinements**
	- **scrutinize traditional prejudices, customary beliefs and common sense assumptions**
- Such freedom and perspective, for Russell, free our actions from narrow-minded self-interest to the **aim for genuine Justice**
- They also free our emotions from partiality to, what Russell calls, "universal love" for all
	- These very practical values, educate, the "citizen of the universe," who is **free from idiosyncratic limitations** and attached to all humanity in her actions and emotions.
- But he immediately warns after, **philosophical study instrumentalized to achieve a higher Self, is self-defeating**
	- Instrumentalization would try and fail to assimilate the greatness of the universe into the boundaries of the Self.
	- The true starting point of philosophy should be instead "not-Self," where Self is sidelined to merely attune and adapt to the greatness of the pursued questions.
	- **There the real guidance is in the desire for knowledge, not for the expansion of Self.**
- **The value of philosophy is in its question.**

Some ideas:

What is instrically true? What is truth and how much do you know?

How do you know that you're not in the matrix?

Cognitive Dissonance
- two conflicting ideas
	- solution
	- ignore the other idea
	- change the other belief
		- relativism (truth does not exist and is not knowable)
		- truth does exist and is knowable

What we really know is based from first premises, something unprovably true. Each one has their own first premises.

Youtuber suggests that common sense is a good first premise. We know that 1+1 = 2 and that we know we aren't in a matrix. We know that there values that everyone must ascribe to.
