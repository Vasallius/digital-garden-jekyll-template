# 🌱 Concavity

## definitions
Here are the formal definitions for concavity at a point:

For an interval:

> 💡 *in my own words:*
A graph is concaved up when **all** the points in that interval are **above** the tangent line. Similarly, a graph is concaved down when **all** the points in that interval are **below** the tangent line.

> We also note that we cannot determine the concavity at end points, undefined points, and at points where the function is undifferentiable.

Here are pictures of examples:

## concavity relation to the second derivative

> 💡 *in my own words:*
We notice that when a function is increasing, `f'(x)` is increasing and the same goes for when a function is decreasing, `f'(x)` decreases.  Thus if the first derivative is increasing then, `f''(x) > 0` (concaved up) and `f''(x) < 0` (concaved down) when the first derivative is decreasing.
