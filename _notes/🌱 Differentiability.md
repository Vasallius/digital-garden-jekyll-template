## Differentiability
- When is a function differentiable?
	- able to differentiate
	- find the derivative
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201009165041.png]]
	- if the derivative exists when an **x** is plugged in, we say it is differentiable at **x**
	- if the derivative exists for all values within an interval , then it is differentiable at the interval **(a,b)**
	- if âˆ€ real numbers the derivative exists, then we say it is differentiable everywhere
- One-sided derivatives
	- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201009170422.png]]
	- similar to [[ðŸŒ± Lec1.2 - One-sided Limits]]
	- both should exist and be equal for the derivative to exist

- Geometric Interpretation

	- non-vertical tangent line
- When is it not differentiable
	- no well defined tangent line
	- corner or cusp

	- discontinuous at x = $x_0$

## Continuity
- if function is differentiable then it is also continuous
- if discontinuous, then it is no differentiable
- if f is continuous, it doesn't follow that it is automatically differentiable
- if f is not differentiable, it doesn't follow that it is automatically discontinuous
