When we confine our ideas to be in a set of categories only, we limit its connection to other ideas that we don't see in that particular hierarchy. This poses a problem as ideas are often inter-linked in many unrealized ways. Luhmann knew this and devised a way for notes to be interlinked through the [[Zettelkasten Method]].
