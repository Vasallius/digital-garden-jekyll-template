- Galatians 6:2
	- God always directs us to be others-focused
		- *bear another's burdens*
	- simple command, look for someone with burdens, help them and bear it with them
	- “Notice the assumption which lies behind this command, namely that we all have burdens and that God does not mean us to carry them alone.” (Stott)
	- we will be known by the love we show to others
		- John 13:34-35
	- “So Paul may be saying to them, in effect, that instead of imposing the law as a burden upon others, they should rather lift their burdens and so fulfill Christ’s law.” (Stott)

		- *stir up* one another
		- Love here is the ancient Greek word agape, filled with significance by the New Testament. “Love needs stimulation and society. Faith and hope can be practiced by a solitary, in a hermit’s cell or on a desert island. But the exercise of love is possible only in a community.” (Robinson)

**Community**—a body of individuals who unite together in fellowship, sharing attitudes, interests, and goals. 

Intimacy with God doesn’t mean shutting yourself off from other people. In fact, sometimes it means **making space for them**. Rest is the perfect time to celebrate life with people you love. We’re not made to do life alone. **We need each other**.

Think about the kind of people you want in your life—people who inspire you to be better, to be more like Jesus. You are directly influenced by the people you spend the most time with. **Are the people you’ve allowed into your life helping you grow?**

*i think this calls for reaching out for people that i may not have reached out*
