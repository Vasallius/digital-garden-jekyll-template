- #### Algorithms
	- specific steps to computer a computation
	- generally fewer steps to computer, the better it is
		- memory usage
	- Muhammad Ibn Al-Khwarizmi
	- Sorting
		- bubble sort
		- spaghetti sort
		- selection sort
			- find smallest
				- start at the top
				- new smallest as you go next
				- after each run, put the smallest at the very beginning
					- start spot lower
				- O (n^2) loops
				- relationship of input size to number of steps = complexity
		- merge sort
			- split into half again and again and again to individual arrays
			- merge each individual array
				- compare the first two number from each array and taking the lowest when merging
			- O(n log n)
		- graph search
			- graph of nodes that is connected
			- line is labeled by number
				- brute force approach
				- try every line
				- O(n!)
			- Edsger Wybe Dijkstra
				- find the lowest distance from starting node to next node
				- try every path, and record
				- find the lowest cost path
				- O(n^2)
				- modified to be O(n log n + 1)
					- nodes and lines
