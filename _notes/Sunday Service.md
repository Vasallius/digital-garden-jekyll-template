### 2 Peter 1:13

> And it is only right that I should keep on reminding you as long as I live.

We all have fear. Fear is a gift from God. Fear has been instilled to us from the beginning

> *Genesis 2:16-17*
16 But the Lord God warned him, “You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden— 17 except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die.”

There is a consequence of eating the fruit. If there was no fear, consequences won't have meaning. Fear is a gift from God to protect us and to keep us with Him.

Why has fear become bad?

Evil is the absence of God.

Computer gadgets are not naturally evil, but if the use of the gadget is not centered on God, it will become evil. 

When fear brings us away from God, it becomes evil.

# From Fear to Trust in God

- Our fear should bring us to God.
- The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.

If we had fear, many of us would have been dead. But because of fear, nag-iingat tayo.

That fear must produce intimacy with our God. 

Healthy fear has something to do with your faith. If you have fear in God, your faith is in God.

## Turn to the Lord

> *Psalm 56:1*
O God, have mercy on me,
for people are hounding me.
My foes attack me all day long.

> *1 Samuel 20:32-33*
32 “But why should he be put to death?” Jonathan asked his father. “What has he done?” 33 Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him. So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David.

---

> *1 Samuel 21:9-10*
9 “I only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah,” the priest replied. “It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. Take that if you want it, for there is nothing else here.”
“There is nothing like it!” David replied. “Give it to me!”
10 So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of **Gath.**

David killed Goliath who was from Gath, carrying Goliath's weapon. Imagine going to Gath at this time haha.

---

> *1 Samuel 21:11-15*
11 But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there. “Isn’t this David, the king of the land?” they asked. “Isn’t he the one the people honor with dances, singing,
‘Saul has killed his thousands,
and David his ten thousands’?”
12 David heard these comments and was **very afraid** of what King Achish of Gath might do to him. 13 So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.
14 Finally, King Achish said to his men, “Must you bring me a madman? 15 We already have enough of them around here! Why should I let someone like this be my guest?”

> *Psalm 56:1*
O God, have mercy on me,
for people are hounding me.
My foes attack me all day long.

---

Lord **HAVE MERCY** on me. Lord

> *Psalm 56:2-3*
2 I am constantly hounded by those who slander me,
and many are boldly attacking me.
3 But when I am afraid,
**I will put my trust in you.**

---

> *Philippians 4:6*
6 Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.

---

> *1 Peter 5:6-7*
6 So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor. 7 **Give all your worries and cares to God**, for he cares about you.

---

> *1 Peter 5:8-9*
8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour. 9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your family of believers[a] all over the world is going through the same kind of suffering you are.

WHEN YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO RUN, RUN TO GOD.

God has not allowed things we cannot handle. God has provided a way out through every temptations we face. Temptations are opportunities to succeed in being more intimate with God. That is the intention of the fear, to protect you, to be with me

---

> *Psalm 34:4-5*
4 I prayed to the Lord, and he answered me.
He **freed me from all my fears**.
5 Those who look to him for help will be **radiant with joy**;
no shadow of shame will darken their faces.

WHERE DO YOU GO? 

When you are afraid turn to God.

## Trust his Word

Prayer is not only about telling God what we need, it also contains God's instructions.

> *Psalm 56:4-*
4 I praise God for what he has promised.
I trust in God, so **why should I be afraid?**
What can mere mortals do to me?
5 They are always twisting what I say;
they spend their days plotting to harm me.
6 They come together to spy on me—
watching my every step, eager to kill me.
7 Don’t let them get away with their wickedness;
in your anger, O God, bring them down.

---

> *Joshua 21:45*
45 Not a single one of all the good promises the Lord had given to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled; **everything he had spoken came true**.

Sometimes we don't know the promises of God, that's why we don't run to him.

> *Joshua 1:8*
8 Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.

Don't judge the situation by what you see but by what God has promised you.

> Psalm 1:1-2
1 Oh, the joys of those who do not
follow the advice of the wicked,
or stand around with sinners,
or join in with mockers.
2 But they delight in the law of the Lord,
meditating on it day and night.

---

> Psalm 1 : 6
6 For the Lord watches over the path of the godly,
but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.

---

> Psalm 119:10-11
10 I have tried hard to find you—
don’t let me wander from your commands.
11 I have hidden your word in my heart,
that I might not sin against you.

---

If u focus on the righteousness of God and the advancement of the kingdom of  God, don't worry the Lord God will take care of you.

---

> *Romans 10:17*
17 So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.

---

> *1 Timothy 2:1-2*
2 I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them. 2 Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity.

Bago ka mag reklamo, pinagpray mo na ba?

Wag mong dibdibin, tuhurin mo.

---

> 1 Peter 3:1
3 In the same way, you wives must accept the authority of your husbands. Then, even if some refuse to obey the Good News, your godly lives will speak to them without any words. They will be won over

ILABAN MO SA DIYOS.

## Trust his Character

> *Psalm 56:8*
8 You keep track of all my sorrows.
You have collected all my tears in your bottle.
You have recorded each one in your book.

{`tear bottle}`

---

Do you really trust God's character and that he is not a sadist?

---

> *James 1:5*
5 If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.

---

> Psalms 56:9
9 My enemies will retreat when I call to you for help.
This I know: **God is on my side!**

ARE YOU CERTAIN GOD IS FOR YOU?

---

> *Romans 8:31-32*
31 What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us? 32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else?

---

God is for us, but are we for Him?

If God is against you, then who can be for you?

---

> *James 4:6-7*
6 And he gives grace generously. As the Scriptures say,
“God opposes the proud
but gives grace to the humble.”
7 So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

---

> Psalm 56:10-11
10 I praise God for what he has promised;
yes, I praise the Lord for what he has promised.
11 I trust in God, so why should I be afraid?
What can mere mortals do to me?

We have no reason to be afraid when we have already put our trust in God.

## Thank Him in Advance

> Psalm 56:12
12 I will fulfill my vows to you, O God,
and will offer a sacrifice of thanks for your help.

---

> Hebrews 13:15
15 Therefore, let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God, proclaiming our allegiance to his name.

---

> Ecclesiastes 5:4-5
4 When you make a promise to God, don’t delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him. 5 It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it.

---

> Psalm 56:13
13 For you have rescued me from death;
you have kept my feet from slipping.
So now I can walk in your presence, O God,
in your life-giving light.
