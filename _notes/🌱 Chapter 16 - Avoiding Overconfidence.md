	- right hemisphere plays devil's advocate
	- left hemisphere of the brain always tries to cling to the way things are
		- when we are in focused mode we may miss out on minor mistakes in our calculations
		- potential for rigidity, dogmatism, and egocentricity
		- try to step back and recheck to take advantage of other parts of the brain
	- >"The first principle is that you must not fool yourself-and you are the easiest person to fool" 
		*Richard Feynman* #quote 
- p. 200 The Value of Brainstorming with Others
	- everyone has blind spots
		- when you think and brainstorm with people you can know what area your thinking has gone astray or wrong
		- catch stuff you missed
		- friends are a larger-scale diffuse mode
	- explaining to your friends aid in understanding
		- be able to say when something is really wrong without worrying about hurting their feelings
	- more friends can also be good for your career as they might be probably be in the same social circles 
	- criticism isn't really about you, it's about what you're trying to understand
	- competition can be a good thing, an intense form of collaboration
	- careful when study sessions become socializing occasions
