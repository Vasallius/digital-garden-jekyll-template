- Algorithm and flowchart are the powerful tools for learning programming.
-  An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process
-  a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way
-  relates to the name of the mathematician Al-khowarizmi
-  used for planning and solvnig problems
-  4 Characteristics
	-  Input: An algorithm may or may not require input
	-  Output: Each algorithm is expected to produce at least one result
	-  Definiteness: Each instruction must be clear and unambiguous
	-  Finiteness: If the instructions of an algorithm are executed, the algorithm should terminate after finite number of steps
-  3 Control Structures
	-  Sequence: In the sequence structure, statements are placed one after the other and the execution takes place starting from up to down
	-  Branching: does something depending on whether the condition is true or false
	-  Loop: execute somethign while a condition is rue
-  Advantage
	-  not dependent on any programming language
	-  easy to debug since every step has its own logical sequence
-  How to Write Algorithms
	-  specify what kind of input you want (e.g. data type) and how many
	-  define the variables, make them meaningful
	-  outline the operations, what do you do with the variables
	-  output the results, return an output value based on the computations made
-  Flowchart
	-  designed by John Von Neumann back in 1945
	-  advantage:
		-  graphical
		-  blueprint
		-  easy to convert into code
	- diagrammatic /Graphical representation of sequence of steps to solve a problem

	- We can use keywords like INPUT or READ or GET to accept input values and PRINT or WRITE or DISPLAY to output results
