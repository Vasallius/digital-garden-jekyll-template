- when approaching from both sides, need to check for both
- First case, when `a` is substituted, the result is not an integer.
	- we simply take the `f(x)` and take the limit of that, then apply the greatest integer function
- Second case, when `a` is substituted, the result is an integer
	- 2a:
		- if the result approaches a value from the right side `+`, we make `f(x)` = `n`
	- 2b
		- if the result approaches a value from the left side `-`, we make `f(x)` = `n-1`
- output is always integer
