### The Sent and the Sender

#### Scripture
[[John]] 20:19-23

#### Observation
>❓ What is the significance of Jesus’ words to His disciples at His first
appearance to them after His resurrection?

Jesus told the disciples, "peace be with you". He also gave them the capability to forgive sins. Jesus as sent by His Father, now sends his disciples to evangelize and fulfill the Great Comission. He appeared to the disciples as proof that He has conquered death and triumphed.

#### Application
>❓ What is my response to the Lord Jesus saying to me, “As the Father has sent Me, even so I am sending you”’?

I shall choose to be sent and fulfill whatever Gd wants me to do.

#### Prayer
