### Sleep Cycle

The [[Kleitman and Richardson Cave Experiment|experiment]] done by Kleitman and Richardson, revealed to us that humans don't just sleep, we cycle between two types of sleep, namely **NREM and REM** sleep. NREM stands for non-rapid eye movement and the latter meant rapid eye movement.

Figure shows how we cycle between these two types of sleep.

This figure shows what our brainwaves look like in these phases.

We can see in the figure that when we are awake our waves look very erratic and random in nature, and in fact that is the case. It is very chaotic. This is because different parts of the brain process information at different speeds. [[Matthew Walker]] puts this in an analogy.

>As an analogy, consider a large football stadium filled with thousands of fans. Dangling over the middle of the stadium is a microphone. e
individual people in the stadium represent individual brain cells, seated in different parts of the stadium, as they are clustered in different regions of the brain. The microphone is the electrode, sitting on top of the head—a recording device

On the other hand, during deep NREM sleep, we see a pattern of waves, dsecending and ascending. [[Matthew Walker]] says that,
>In this regard, you can think of each individual slow wave of NREM sleep as a courier, able to carry packets of information between different anatomical brain centers. One benefit of these traveling deep-sleep brainwaves is a file-transfer process. Each night, the long-range brainwaves of deep sleep **will move memory packets (recent experiences) from a shortterm storage site, which is fragile, to a more permanent, and thus safer, longterm storage location.** We therefore consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the **reception** of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward **reflection**—one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories.

If waking is reception, and deep NREM sleep is reflection, then what would REM sleep be like? Why are its waves very active and frantic similar to when we are awake?

Research shows that
>Indeed, recent MRI scanning studies have found that there are individual parts of the brain that are up to 30 percent more active during REM sleep than when we are awake!

Very interesting. Why would the brain be very active when we are dreaming? Apparently, the thalamus opens during REM sleep, allowing emotions and memories to be played in our minds.

[[Matthew Walker]] calls this phase as a state of **integration**, (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).

When we dream, our muscles are frozen by a powerful disabling signal that affects our spinal cord. This makes us unable to move when we are dreaming, or at least we shouldn't be able to.

Why would the brain do this? Well, **the brain paralyzes the body so the mind candream safely.**
