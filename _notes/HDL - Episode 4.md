### Episode 4

This episode we get to see Chan Seong and Man Weol become more and more connected. We also see that the old tree in the garden blooms flowers when Chan Seong touches it. This may signify that Man Weol's life is resuming again. Chan Seong sees more of Man Weol in his dreams. I feel like he was the guy in the past. The hotel staff look to get rid of Chan Seong by sending Him to room 13 but here we see Man Weol intervening and kissing him huhuhu.

Here's Man Weol in pretty outifts again..

>Jang Man Weol:  Do you think I'm some seedling that sprouts when you give it water? I'm an old tree that has been dry for over a thousand years.

>Thoughts:
> I think we are all seedlings capable of growth when water is sprinkled upon us. This water is ofcourse things we in take that help us grow. We can also look at it like God as the living water, making us seedlings grow

>Jang Man Weol: Ku Chan Seong. Look after me.

>Thoughts:
> Man Weol now wants to be looked after, awww how cute. A strong independent woman now wants to be cared for. And, I relate. I want someone to look after me with such care and tenderness


>Jang Man Weol: Don't we all get a little crazy sometimes?

>Thoughts:
>Oh boy, we certainly do. We get crazy for people or objects and IU, im crazy for you.


>Ku Chan Seong: If something happens to me, I'm sure you'll protect me. I know it was you. I jumped in because I trusted you.
>Jang Man Weol: I said, it wasn't me.
>Ku Chan Seong: I trust that you will protect me. So please protect me when something happens to me. I will stay right next to you.

>Thoughts:
> Chan Seong was pretty bold enough to jump in front of a speeding motorcycle but he knew He was safe in Man Weol's hands. The kind of trust here is wonderful. Similar to Jesus, we can trust Him that He will protect us.
