- p. 195 **Introduction to David Hume's Arguments**
	- healthy skepticism is needed for miraculous stuff
		- don't claim miracle status for things that can be explained using natural laws
	- there is a difference between miracles and supernatural events
		- miracles are supernatural events but not vice versa
	- Hume states that miracles violate laws of nature
		- there must be uniform experience to merit miracle status
	- two arguments: 
	- **uniformity of nature**
		- miracles are violations of law of nature
		- these laws have been established by firm and unalterable experience
		- arguments from miracles are as good as any argument from experience
	- **uniformity of experience**
		- unusual, not frequently observed
		- resurrection would be a miracle since it has not yet been observed
		- there should be uniform experience to merit miracle status
		
- p. 197 **The argument from the uniformity of nature - Hume's self-contradictory position**
	- just because the sun has risen every single day in the past does not mean it will rise tomorrow
		- just because no one has risen from the dead the entire x number of years does not mean that no one will rise from the dead the next x years	
		- example of decapitation, before it wasn't a thing doesn't mean Charles I was not decapitated
		- **uniformity is one thing, absolute uniformity is another**
	- Hume says we cannot use the past experience to predict the future
	- nature isn't uniform so you can't argue against miracles
	- resurrection of Christ - supreme evidence

- p. 199 **Miracles and the Laws of nature**
	- Hume: all events are entirely loose and separate
		- unobservable tie between
		- explicitly denies necessary connection
			- billiard ball analogy
		- denies causal relationships
			- attack on Hume's theory of causation: Alfred North Whitehead
			- people blink to light
				- science shows that the existence of a complex casual chain
		- since he denies causation, nature cannot be the preclude for miracles
	- argument 1
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20347.png)
			- accounts of miracles are from barbaric nations
			- you cannot recognize what is abnormal if you do not know what is normal
			- Luke (doctor and historian) account pf Zechariah and Elizabeth conceiving a son
				- politely refused to believe at first
				- was not prepared to believe since he was a Christian
				- objection to resurrection weren't atheists, they were high priests

	- argument 2
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20349.png)
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20350.png)
		- laws of nature are supposed to predict what should happen without God's intervention
			- intervention doesn't violate the laws
		- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20351.png)
		- resurrection did not happen by a natural mechanism
			- supernatural power
		- Christians do not deny the laws of nature


- p. 203 **Hume's argument from the uniformity of experience**
	- Hume assumes that there has never been miracles in the past. as such miracles in the future cannot happen
	- impossible to even know in the first place

- p. 204 **Hume's criteria for evidence and the credibility of witnesses**
	- strength of the belief lies in the strength of the evidence
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%20352.png)
		- scientists believe in the big bang, absolute uniformity is impossible
