### Factors that determine when you sleep

Matthew Walkers say that there are two factors affecting sleep.
- First is a signal beamed out from your internal twenty-four-hour clock located deep within your brain. This known as the circadian rhythm.

	- Plants have these kind of rhythm and was proven by the experiment of Jean Marian on the plant ***Mimosa pudica.***

	- After a long period of time, it was also proven by Professor Kleitman and Bruce Richardson that we humans have this internal clock.

	- We humans have different rhythms or chronotypes.

	- Melatonin signals sleep.

- Second is a chemical substance that builds up in your brain and creates a "sleep pressure"
	- This chemical is called adenosine.

- Below are the two factors plotted in a graph.

These factors are independent of one another.

- It is illustrated in this graph that the greater the distance between the two processes, the more likely we are to sleep
