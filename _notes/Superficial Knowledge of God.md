### Superficial Knowledge of God

#### Scripture
[[Mark|Mark 8:27-29]]

**Mark 8:27-29 (NLT)
Peter’s Declaration about Jesus**

27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, “Who do people say I am?”

28 “Well,” they replied, “some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets.”

29 Then he asked them, “But who do you say I am?”

Peter replied, “You are the Messiah.[a]”

#### Observation

>What is the significance of Jesus’ two questions in verses 27 and 29?

Jesus asked what people thought of Him and clearly people had a wrong idea who Jesus was. They thought that he was John the Baptist, Elijah, or just some mere prophet. But Peter answers that he was the [[Messiah]].

![[Who do we say Jesus is]]

#### Application

>What does it mean for me to have who God is as my primary interest and focus, as He blesses, cares and helps me?

It means that it is not the blessings and provisions I must seek, but rather I must direct my focus to God himself. I shall seek to understand Him more and not be like the people who did not know Him.

#### Prayer

Lord, thank you for waking me up another day and giving life into me. Lord, you are perfect and absolute. I come into Your presence. Lord, I ask forgiveness for the sins of the flesh, I am weak and I did not run away. Please forgive me and help me develop resistance to attacks like this. Lord I also thank you that you are using me to guide Adrienne and starting over again, continue to sustain me, Lord. Lastly, Lord give me wisdom and knowledge to seek out what you want for Him. Lord, if it is your will give me the macbook.
