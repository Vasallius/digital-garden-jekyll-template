	- **your desire to figure things out right now is what prevents you from being able to figure things out**
	- focus then diffuse, alternation between these methods help the thoughts marinate in different areas of our brain
	- **reshaping our brain is under our control. the key is patient persistence-working knowledgably with our brain's strength's and weaknesses**
	- this leads to well-formed neural structures with well-cured mortar everytime we learn something
	- rote-memorization is an illusion that you actually understand math and science
	- don't lose the forest for trees
	- lockmaster's secret was knowing the default settings of the manafacturer
		- if we can understand our brain's default settings and take advantage of it, we can b experts

		  -  use flashcards 
	  -  Chunk Your Problems
		  -  after you solve a problem solve it again and make sure you understand every single step
	  -  Space your repetition
		  -  spread out learning in any subject
	  -  Alternate different problem-solving techniques during practice
		  -  don't focus on type of problem
		 -  work on different types of problem
	 -  Take breaks
		 -  take a break and let your mind work in the background
	 - Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies
		 -   try to explain it to a 5 year old

 -   p. 222 Ten Rules of Bad Studying
	 -   Passive rereading
			- rereading is a waste of time
		- letting highlights overwhelm you
			- you think that what you highlight actually goes into your brain but it doesn't
			- a little highlighting helps but don't overdo it
		- merely glancing a problem and thinking you know how to do it
			- you need to not feel cocky and actually solve the problem step by step
		- waiting until last minute to study
			- just don't cram
		- repeatedly solving problems you already know how to solve
			- why practice something you're already good at
		- dont let study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions
			- waste of time
		- neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems
			- would you dive into a pool before you knew how to swim?
		- not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion
			- instructors are there to instruct you so what are you waiting for
		- thinking you can learn deeply when you are constantly distracted
			- interrupted attention pulls out tiny neural roots
		- not getting enough sleep
			- in sleep your brain forms connections
			- fatigue also builds up toxin
			- nothing else matters aside from this
