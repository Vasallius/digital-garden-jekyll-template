- using the first derivative
	- function is increasing if `h'(x) > 0`(positive) when `x > 0`
	- function is decreasing if `h'(x) < 0` (negative) when `x < 0`
- using the second derivative
	- a point is a candidate [[ðŸŒ± Inflection Points]] when `f''(x) == 0` and points before and after that, switches sign
	- a point is a [[ðŸŒ± Maximum and Minimum Points]] if the first derivative at that point is `> 0 ` , then it is concave upwards, if it is `< 0`, then it is concave downwards
