In times that we think God is distant and has no care or involvement in our life, it is because we let him be distant. It is us who have constantly pushed God away, not wanting anything to do with Him. But when we need Him in prayer, He will always be there, at the place we pushed Him away. It's amazing how persistent and never-forsaking God is, despite us continuously denying Him and indulging in the World's pleasures.

>“I think the reason we sometimes have the false sense that God is so far away is because that is where we have put him. We have kept him at a distance, and then when we are in need and call on him in prayer, we wonder where he is. He is exactly where we left him.”
>*Ravi Zachiarias*
