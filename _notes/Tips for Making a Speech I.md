### 10 Tips to Creating a Magical Valedictorian Speech
1. Whatever You Do, Do Not Talk About Webster's Dictionary
	- Don't define words using the dictionary
	- It's very cliche
2. Talk About What You've Learned in Your Valedictorian Speech
3. Make a Few Jokes
	- use jokes that everyone understands, a boring speech is dreading to hear
4. Inspire Your Fellow Students
	- inspire by making them feel like they are amazing people who are ready to conquer the world
5. Use Quotes
	- maybe use a quote as a central theme of your speech?
6. Keep It Short and Sweet
	- Therefore, don't ramble on forever. Your speech should be no more than 10 minutes unless you're given other instructions.
7. Speak to Other Students
8. Make Your Most Important Point the Final Point
	- End with a punch
9. Always Practice Your Speech Before Hand
10. Thank People
	-	Always thank people in your speech. You didn't become the valedictorian on your own. And your fellow graduates didn't get to the stage on their own either.
