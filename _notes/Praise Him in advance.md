>*Psalm 13:5-6*
>5 But I trust in your unfailing love;
    my heart rejoices in your salvation.
6 I will sing the Lordâ€™s praise,
    for he has been good to me.
	
Here, David was wrestling with God. He is facing with enemies far greater than Him. But, what did he do? He trusted in God's unfailing love and sang praises. In times of turmoil do we practice this? Mosto f the time when we are in a bad situation all we can think about is ourselves, we fall short of the goodness of God. This should be a reminder that we are to praise Him in advance.

An example to this is, should you pray before you fly an airplane or before you crash and die?
