Frozen column or row headers, for example, are always visible to the user even as they scroll through the spreadsheet. These are known as **freeze panes**.

To unfreeze all panes, set freeze_panes to `None` or 'A1'.

Note that all rows above and all columns to the left of this cell will be frozen, but the row and column of the cell itself will not be frozen.
