- p. 176 **Information and the design argument**
	- existence of complex specified information could not be merely be by unguided natural processes; an intelligent source was responsible
	- design inference is stronger in DNA
		- Stephen Meyer
			- DNA possesses identical feature that intelligently designed texts and programs exhibit
			- supported by Information Theorist Hubert Yockey
		- inference to the best explanation
			- causes that are able to produce that effect compared to causes we do not know that are capable of producing that effect
			- *a fortriori*
		- an archaeologist knows that he is dealing with an artifact when he sees flints, not just a weathered stone

- p. 177 **The search for extra-terrestrial intellegence and its implications**
	- how does science detect intelligence?
		- how do you know that it's from a being rather than it being random?
		- compare with patterns specified in advanced that is clear, then make a design inference
	- why do we look for intellgience outside our planet and not inside our planet?
		- inconsistent
		- why is there flak when scientists claim that there is intelligent causation in physics or biology
	- simple cells contains extreme amounts of extreme complexity and yet we can't say there was a designer?

- p. 179 **Information as a fundamental quantity**
	- information may be regarded as a fundamental quantity
	- in the beginning was the bit - Hans Beyer
	- in the beginning was the Word - John	
	- what is seen is made out of what is invisible
		- carriers of information may be visible but information may be not

- p. 180 **The complexity of God: a fatal objection?**
	- Who created God?
		- dumb argument: DNA was always there
		- however, this was not the case
	- if we were to reject explanations that are more complex than what they are supposed to be explaining, then we would reject a lot of science
		- falling of an apple
			- gravity
			- curved space-time

	- explanatory powers trump simplicity
	- dawkins in the movie expelled recognizes design as a principle of science
	- why is that when we see something simple we attribute up to an intellgient designer but when we see something complex we attribute it to chance and necessity

- p. 184 **Who made God?**
	- infinite regress problem
	- we do not believe in a created God
		- God is eternal

- p. 186 **Is there anything eternal?**
	- eternal mindless matter is acceptable but not an eternal God? HAHAHAH
