### Day 5 - Mark 4

- Jesus uses parables

---

- Parable of the Sower
	- Jesus wants us to listen
	- Parables help people understand
	- God won't force Himself to anyone
	- Word of God is a seed
	- seed is always the same but the dirt is different
		- seed along the path	
		- rocky places
		- thorns
		- good soil
- The Parable of the Growing Seed
	- man scattering seeds
	- the seeds grows but the man does not know how
	- ministry is easier than you think
		- just plant seeds
- Jesus Calms the Storm
	- storm brewed and the disciples were worried 
	- they woke up Jesus as he was sleeping
	- Jesus rebuked them of their little faith
	- disciples were amazed that even the wind and waves obey him

What kind of soil are you? Is your faith easily snatched away by Satan? Jesus reminds us in this chapter using parables about the Seed and how powerful it is. It can grow and multiply more than you can ever imagine. Planting seeds does not really have to be hard, just do your part and God will do the rest. In the troubles of life, are we like the disciples who lack faith? Did we not forget that our God has complete command over everything?
