This lecture touched on three major topics:
- one-sided limits
- piecewise function
- greatest integer function

One sided limits are limits that only approach x from either left or right side. The limit may not exist but the one-sided limit may exist. A good exampel of this is the square root function since square root functions cannot take in negative radicands.

Piecewise functions are functions that have different function values depending on your `x` value. What is important to us here is the function values where x is greater than or less than `a`.

For greatest integer function, we can solve it with two cases.

### Square Root function
- $\sqrt{L}$ > 0 , limit exists
- $\sqrt{L}$ > 0, limit does not exist
- $\sqrt{0^{+}}$ > 0, limit = 0
-  $\sqrt{0^{-}}$ > 0, limit does not exist
-  **does not exist if approached from both side and radican = 0**
