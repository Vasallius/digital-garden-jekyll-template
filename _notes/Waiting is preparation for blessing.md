When we wait, God molds our heart and character to either the point we are ready to accept the blessing we want, or to the point where we want something else due to our hearts being changed. Waiting is a difficult process and in this world of fast-going and instant stuff, no one would like to wait. But [[When God seems silent, wait on Him|waiting]] is a process where God teaches us to rely on Him and to trust that He will deliver in his due time.
