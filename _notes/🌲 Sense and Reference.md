## introduction
- what is game?
	- can you really define what a game is
- question of meaning
	- what do words, x, y, and z mean?
	- how do we know what they mean?
	- who gets to decide?
- language
	- very nuanced
	- **how do words - a collection of sounds or symbols - key into the mental concepts that we want to communicate?**

- Gotlab Frege
	- âœ¨ **reference**
		-  object or concept that it's meant to designate
	- âœ¨  **sense**
		-  way in which the words tie us to the object of concept
-  definition
	-  **understood as whatever meets the condition for both necessity and sufficiency**
	-  âœ¨ **necessary condition**
		-  what's needed
		-  what must be present, in order for a thing to be a thing
		-  in order for x to be x 
		-  to be a bachelor, you must be unmarried
	-  âœ¨ **sufficient condition**
		-  something that's enough for x to be x but it's not required for that thing to meet that condition
		-  being born in the US is sufficient to be an American citizen

## ludwig wittgenstein
- **definitions doesn't work**
	- people will probably give a counter example
	- something that's include that everyone doesn't agree
	- something that's excluded by the definition
	- however, this doesn't matter, because:
		-  everyone knows what a game is
		-  we learn and know the meaning by hearing the way other community members use the word
- âœ¨ **family resemblance**
	- we see connections from the different games and genuses
	- see: [[ðŸŒ²  Concept of Philosophy Lecture Video#anatomy of a definition|What makes up a definition?]]
-  instead of rigid definitions, word meanings are **cluster concepts**
	-  no one element that everything in the cluster that has common
	-  but they all share something with some other members of the group
	-  âœ¨** paradigm cases** (core)
		-  ones which everyone will accept
	-  âœ¨ **fringe case** (outer part)
		-  ones only some will include in the group
	-  language is a living thing and it will go through various changes and reiterations
-  **"meaning is use"**
	-  as long as the community uses that word in that way then it has that meaning
	-  we make up words as we need them
-  our minds are like boxes, no one really knows what others have in their boxes
	-  thus, we can't meaningfully use, for example the word, "game" because we don't know what others mean when they use that word
-  **it's impossible to directly communicate our subjective experiences**
-  "language can't refer directly to an internal state"
	-  only refer to whats observable by other people
-  **can we create meaning?**
	-  speaker meaning
		-  speaker intends
	-  audience meaning
		-  what the audience understands
	-  the goal is to make it match but they often fail to connect especially in nuanced words and ideas

	<summary> <b>What is a definition according to Gotlab Frege?</b></summary>
	It is what meets the condition for both necessity and sufficiency. Necessity is a requirement for x to be x while sufficiency is something that's enough x to be x but is not required to meet that condition.

	<summary> <b>According to Ludwig Wittgenstein, why do definitions not work?</b></summary>
	Definitions may exclude or include things that not everybody will agreeon. Definitions for him are supposesd to be cluster of concepts since no element has everything in the cluster have in common. Thus, the core is the paradigm where almost everybody agrees with the things in that area while the outer areas are fringe cases where some may agree and some may not.

	Meaning is use. We make up words as we seem fit. The goal is to match the speaker meaning and the audience meaning.
