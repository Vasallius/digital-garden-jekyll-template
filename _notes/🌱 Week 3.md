![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201001144123.png]]
- 1947 ish
	- science and study on archaeology was very limited
- Before the first wave
	- there was people in the Philippines already
	- "core population" / Dawn Man
		- from the dawn of time, they were already there
		- speculation only
		- around 250,000 BC
- **First Wave**
	- 2 pygmy groups
		- smaller people
		- "Negrito"
	- 30,000 to 25,000 BC	
		- Australoid-Sakai type
	- Land Bridges ( Palawan and Mindoro )
- **Second Wave**
	- Proto-malays
		- prototype
		- advanced forms of the malay
	- lived at Mindoro and Palawan
	- using boats instead of land bridge from Borneo
		- ice caps melted already
		- water level increased, thats why land bridges sunk
- **Third wave**
	- two sub waves
	- Indonesians A
		- tall
		- slender
		- light skin complexion
	- Indonesians B
		- shorter
		- stockier? pahaba?
		- darker skin tone
	- both from Indochina towards Formosa and Taiwan and Philippines
	- 6,000 to 5,000 B.C.
- **Fourth Wave**
	- Malays from the south
	- migrated around Iron Age
		- imparted knowledge to PH People
			- seafaring
			- pottery iron works
			- glassmaking
			- cloth weaving
- **debunked already**
	- around 1970
	- F Landa Jocano
- archaeological evidence that Beyer cites is very limited and very arbitrary

### Austronesian Migration Theory
- Peter Bellwood Mainland Origin Hypothesis (Out of Taiwan Model)
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201001145752.png]]
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201001145416.png]]
- austro (south) nesis (island)
	- southern islanders
	- some similarities between filipino and some languages
- northern Philippines ( Luzon )
	- travelled using boats
- reasons to migrate
	- population growth
	- instability in terms of production of food source
- replaced hunting iwth agricultural methods
- boat building is inherently an austronesian culture
- route

	- pink arrows
	- **north to south**

### Island Origin Theory
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201001150502.png]]
- south to north
	- from mindanao and northern indonesia
- trade-language developed to understand trading partner
- green arrows

### Core Population Theory
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201001151201.png]]
- probably external influences weren't needed
	- because of adaptation
	- boatbuilding - archipelago
	- agriculture - food
- there was already tradition and culture
- core population is not static
	- adapted  migrants' culture and evolved their own culture
	- distinct culture
	- encriched by adapting
