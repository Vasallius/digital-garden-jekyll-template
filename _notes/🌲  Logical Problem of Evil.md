## logical problem

- with all the suffering in the world, how then can anyone believe in an all-loving all-powerful God
- Epicurus frames the problem like this:
	- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023085740.png]]
- The argument is as follows:
- $p_1$: it's logically impossible for God and suffering to both exist
- $p_2$: suffering exists
- $c$: therefore, God does not
- these two statements are not logically consistent
	- no explicit contradiction between the two premises 
	- therefore there might be hidden assumptions behind the two statements

## debunking assumption 1
- Assumption1 : if God is all-powerful, he can create any world he wants
- What if God wanted a world where humans had free will
	- God would not force someone to do something
	- Forcing free choices is like making a square-circle
	- After all, God can't make logically impossible tasks
		- see: [[üìã Omnipotence Paradox Debunked]]
	- however, not feasible because people won't always choose to do what is morally good

## debunking assumption 2
- Assumption 2: if God is all-loving, he prefers a world without suffering
- how would we possibly know this?
- **we permit suffering in order to bring about a greater good**
	- so if God wants to bring about a greater good through suffering, we cannot say that He prefers a world without suffering
- for this argument to succeed, you must show that it's logically impossible that free will exists.
- and, that it's logically impossible that God has good reasons for permitting suffering
- however, this burden of proof is too heavy to bear

## conclusion from philosophers
- J.L. Mackie [Atheist], The Miracle of Theism, p. 154
	- "We can concede that the problem of evil does not after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another."
- William L. Rowe [Atheist]. The Problem of Evil and Some Varieties of Atheism, p.335
	- "Some philosophers havve contended that the existence of evil is logically inconsistent with the existence of the theistic God. No one, I think, has succeeded in establishing such a extravagant claim"
- William P. Alston, The Inductive Argument from Evil and the Human Condition, pp.29-67
	- "It is now acknowledged on almost all sides that the logical argument is bankrupt"
