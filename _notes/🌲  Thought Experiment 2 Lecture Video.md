## intro 
>  If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things. - Rene Descartes
- The more answers we provide, the more questions we generate.
- Thought experiment covered various areas of philosophy
	- ethics
	- religion
	- metaphysics
	- epistemology

## some questions
- **ethics**
	- is goodness absolute?
	- are the standards of goodness objective and universal
	- what is good?
	- what does it mean to say something is good, moral, right, permissible?
	- where does the human concept of goodness come from?
- ** philosophy of religion**
	- is morality innate or endowed?
	- where does moral intuition come from?
	- is morality an exercise of free will?
	- are we really free if we are inclined to choose goodness?
	- did it come from a supreme being?
		- which supreme being?
		- is God a single being? or a number of omni-beings?
		- is God even a being or a mere construct?
	- is God's existence a self-evident truth?
		- does God even exist?
	- do moral truths exists? or are they contructs too?
- **metaphysics**
	- what is real?
	- when do we say something is real?
	- is realness dependent on perception?
	- when you can't see it doesn't it mean it's not real?
	- when do we derive statements of opinion from statement of facts
	- is the jump from facts to opinions a logical move
	- can an ought be derived from an is
	- do statements of facts imply moral duties and obligations?
- **epistemological**
	- when does believing become justified?
	- is a belief synonymous to good?
	- when you believe x is good, does that make x good?
	- can personal beliefs be applied to others?

## euthypro's dilemma
- is goodness based on divine commands?
- is morality subjective/relative?
- see: [[üå≤  Euthypro Dilemma]], [[üå≤  Moral Argument#answering the euthypro dilemma|Answering the Euthypro Dilemma]]

## ethics and key terms and theories
- **morality** is the set of standards and principles of right conduct
- a moral act is an act based on a moral principle
	- for the Greeks, any act that leads to living a good life
- **ethics** is the study of morality
	- semantics of morality ‚ú® (**metaethics**)
	- components of moral acts ‚ú® (**normative ethics**)
	- applications of these to specific issues and contexts ‚ú®(**applied ethics**)

## arguments for subjective morality
- **Point 1: There is a disagreement as to what is moral or not.**
- **Point 2: There seems to be no universal moral principles.**
- **Point 3: Morality of actions are context-dependent.**

## objections to subjective morality

- ‚ú® **subjective absolutism**
	- an action is right **if it is approved by someone**
	- example: 
		- stealing is approved by John, therefore stealing is right
		- but what if Peter approves of it?
		- does it become right AND wrong at the same time?
	- contradiction
	- it cannot be true and false at the same time
- ‚ú® **subjective relativism**
	- an action is right for someone if the action is **approved by that person**
	- very problematic
	-  right for that person if that person thinks it is right
	- has bizarre consequence
	- implies that every individual is morally infallible
	- **believing something that is right does not make it right**
	- all moral disagreements are not genuine disagreements
		- since morality is a matter of prefence and belief
	- all acts are justifiably moral
	- we cannot hold anybody responsible
	- statements of morality should translate to obligation and accountability
- ‚ú®**emotivism**
	- a moral statement is **an expression of emotion**
	-  no moral pronouncements
		- not real statements with truth values
		- merely expressions of feelings
	- also problematic
	- seeing an immoral act right in front of eyes
		- just close your eyes to make it feel not immoral
	- one can easily be mistaken by one feelings
	- **morality is NOT reducible to one's feelings**
- ‚ú® **cultural relativism**
	- an action is right **if your culture approves of it**
	-  most empirically supported one'
	-  there must be no binding moral standard for everyone
	- just because cultures disagree on something, there are no universal moral standards
	- implies that cultures are morally infallible
		- thus, impossible to disagree with one's culture
	- **however, cultures are NOT morally infallible**
- **‚ú® divine command theory**
	- an action is right** if God or a supreme being approves of it**
	- commanding bad actions would not have been made right
	- if goodness is how we define God, we cannot use God to define good ness because the definition will be circular

## objective morality
- **Point 1: There are universal moral principles, e.g. principes of justice (equals must be treated equally) and mercy (unnecessary suffering is wrong), and self-preservation (man ought to survive).**
- **Point 2: There are moral virtues commong among societies. These are justice and prudence among others.**
- something that is objective means that it isn't dependent on anything
	- moral principles that are self-evidently true regardless of the perception of any perceiving subjects
- whenever equals are not treated equally, a wrong has been committed (justice)
- **some suffering is necessary to bring about the greater good**
	- but unnecessary suffering is wrong no matter what

## david hume
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023140159.png]]
- **argues that moral principles can never be derived from facts**
- it is painful to be spanked
- if u get spanked the feeling is painful and unbearable
- ‚à¥ you should not be spanked
	- false, does not follow from the premise
- there is an unnecessary jump
- the *is* does not conclude an *ought*
- empirical facts are just empirical facts and can serve as basis for morality of actions

## philosophy of religion and metaphysics
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023141200.png]]
- God is good himself and be good to the fullest extent to be able to author morality

## 3 types of statements
- **statements are only either true or false**
- ‚ú® **empirical or synthetic**
	- **statements of ordinary perception**
	- **a posteriori true or true after experience**
	- **corresponse theory of truth**
	- make use of 5 senses
	- example:
		- there is a computer in front of you
		- the lights are turned on inside the room
		- the room is humid
		- these statements are true based on the correspondence theory of truth
	- something is true if it corresponds to reality
	- true if it corresponds to objects of reality
	- **a posteriori**
- ‚ú® **evaluative**
	- **claims or judgment of value**
	- **neither true nor false**
	- **intersubjective consensus or argeement**
	- it is beautiful, it is sumptuous
	- murder is wrong, keeping promises is right
	- problematic because:
		- no legitimate truth values
		- expressions of preference
		- neither true nor false
	- becomes "true" or "acceptable" if a group of people consensually agree that such is the case
- ‚ú® **formal or analytic**
	- **statements of identiy in wihch the subject and predicate are interchangeable**
	- **a priori or true before experience**
	- **coherence theory of truth**
	- necessarily true
	- bachelors are unmarried men
		- you do not need to look for a bachelor to confirm whether or not he is married
	- if subject and predicate are one and the same thing
	- **a priori**

## goodness
- what does it mean to say that "God is good"?
	- **is** makes the statement ambiguous
	- "is" being an  **empirically** connector
		- problematic because
		- God is hardly recognizable in the world
		- not even an empirical subject
		- impossible to verify empirically
		- good is not empirically
			- sense and perfection would be insufficient
	- "is" being an **evaluative** connector
		- still problematic
		- will require an intersubjective consensus of people
		- presence of evil and suffering make it difficult to come up with a consensus
	- "is" being an analytic statement
		- most consistent
		- God is **necessarily good** and is defined as the epitomy of goodnesss
		- God is perfect goodness
		- perfect goodness is God
		- "God is a disembodied mind with positive superlative characteristics or qualities"
		- God is a said to be a mind without a body
		- omnibenevolence
		- St Thomas Aquinas
			- God is simply IS God 
			- God ‚áî Goodness
			- God and goodness are extricably linked
