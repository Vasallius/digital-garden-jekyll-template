We can compare strings with each other using operators such as `< > and ==`. Take note tho that the comparison is done in **lexicographical order**. Meaning that this is how humans normally arrange stuff, compare the first letter, then if it's the same, compare the next letter and so on.

*Remark:* Capital letters take precedence over small letters
