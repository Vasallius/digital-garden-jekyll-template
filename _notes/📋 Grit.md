- Preface and Chapter 1 **Showing Up**
	- The author was told that she was no genius but eventually wins an award for it, ironic. The author conducts studies on military training camp, salespeople, college students, and spelling bee champions. Grit was a good predictor for those who stayed and left and for those who thrived and did not.
	- Talent and grit have no correlation with each other. Even the most talented end up dropping out and giving up compared to those who started with lesser innate talent, however, they were grittier.
	- > Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another.
- Chapter 2 **Distracted by Talent**

	- Multiple stories of kids that were placed in groups in which they were considered as slow learners or low iqs but in reality they were not. Aptitude tests got a lot of this wrong.
