### HDL - Epsiode 9

In this episode, Man Wol relocates the hotel and leaves Ku Chan Seong hanging. Chan Seong is offered a medicine that undos his ability to see ghosts however he refuses because he loves Man Weol. However, Chan Seong finds his way back as he escorts the late chairman. A spirit enters the hotel and Joon Hyun and Yu Na find a couple of ghosts probably killed by the friend of Sanchez and Chan Seong. Very interesting to how the story proceeds.


Here's IU and her outfits teehee

>Thoughts:
> Ku Chan Seong hesitates to not eat the medicine that allows him to not see ghost and the hotel anymore. This is because the most important person would not be seen as well. Most of us hesitate as well, and it's pretty wonderful. To give up stuff for someone or something. It may be for a lover or it may be for God.


>Ku Chan Seong:  If you just ask me to come back, I can be there immediately.
