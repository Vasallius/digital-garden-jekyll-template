>"Walanag matigas na puso sa mainit na panalangin"

Simple translated, there is no hard heart that cannot be softened by fiery prayer.

Oftentimes we are very compelled to change a person by providing facts and bombarding them with reasons to believe our faith but oftentimes we forget to pray and [[ðŸŒ± Model the Gospel]].

As [[Oswald Chambers]] have said, [[ðŸ—¯  Prayer does not fit us for the greater work; Prayer is the greater work|prayer does not fit us for the greater work. It  is the greater work]].

Thus, let us be fervent in praying for the people we want to bring to Christ.
