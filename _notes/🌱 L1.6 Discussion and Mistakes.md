Here we first prove that `x` is in the domain of `ln x`, which is the interval `(0,âˆž)`. To do this we show that the function fits the exponential function and is **always positive**, hence satisfying the domain of `ln x`. We then simply raise `e` to the `ln` of the exponential function.

Restrict the ranges first. Be careful with the supposed signs and what quadrant the angle is.

Here is is important that you know the how `0` is approached as `x` approaches $\frac{pi}{2}$. You need to know the behavior of function `cos` in this scenario.

Here we need to know, how $\frac{pi}{2}$ in the function `Arctan`.
