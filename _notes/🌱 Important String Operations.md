- `str[i]` the subscript operation extracts the iâ€™th character of the string, as a new string.
- `str[i:j]` the slice operation extracts a substring out of a string.
- `str.find(target)` returns the index where target occurs within the string, or -1 if it is not found.
	- can define start and end points for searching
	- `str.rfind(target)` can be useful if you're looking for the last occurence since it searches from backwards
- `lower` and `upper` for case conversion
	- `swapcase` for changing lower to upper and upper to lower
- `split` for splitting into words or a list of lines
