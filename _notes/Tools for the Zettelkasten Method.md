To be able to employ the [[Zettelkasten Method]],
we need three things.
1. Inbox - where we store our unprocessed and raw ideas.
2. Reference manager - contains our links and sources of information, recommended is [[Zotero]].
3. The Zettelkasten - where we dump all of our notes and make conenctions.
