### HDL - Episode 5

This episode the ghost at Room 13 escapes. Ku Chan Seong helps a dead bride to get married and eventually be sent off. However Man Wol doesn't agree to marry of Chan Seong and instead lets his best friend pick up the red pocket. But in the end, the dead bride departs for the afterlife by herself. At the ending part of the episode, it's kinda hinted that Ku Chan Seong would be the one to send off Man Wol, and I probably will be extremely sad.

Here's IU serving some looks again

>Thoughts:
> Man Weol said this when they were discussing of different other ways to get rid of Chan Seong, however, it seem that our Man Wol has developed feelings for Chan Seong. All I can say is please keep me by your side too.


>Ku Chan Seong: I'm actually a bit of a softie, so I tend to repay favours by ten times the amount.

> Sigh. Today Jeremy just shouted at mom and looking back, I can imagine how much mom suffered and sacrificed for us, because again there is no limit when it comes to loving their kids
