>Your unconscious mind is a pattern recognition machine. Once you start exposing it to Japanese, it will immediately get to work decoding the sound system, grammar, and lexicon of the language. You’ll slowly start understanding more and more, but won’t be able to explain why. This is the counter-intuitive mechanism of language acquisition. It might be something that’s hard to fully grasp until you’ve started experiencing it for yourself.

Just by continuously exposing yourself to the language you want to learn, the brain slowly gets to decode various language technicalities such as grammar and pronounciation.
