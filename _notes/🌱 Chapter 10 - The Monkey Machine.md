- p. 165 **Typing monkeys**
	- argument is: if you give monkeys a typewriter, they would eventually randomly type out one of Shakespeare's work
	- counterargument: if a monkey could type one letter per nano second it would take him way more than the estimated age of the universe to type Hamlet
		- Russel Grigg on his Article "Could Monkeys Type the 23rd Psalm?"
			- it would take them 34 hours to type the word 'the'
			- 10^1017 years to type the psalm
		- assembling a haemoglobin (4 chains of amino acids)
			- each chain has 146 amino acids (20 amino acid choices)
			- the chance of arranging them is 10^190, there are only 10^70 protons in the entire universe
	- purely random processes cannot account for the complexity of life
		-  life cannot have had a random beginning

	- Evolutionary Biologist Sir Ronald Fisher
		- most advantageous traits do not get preserved and also get wiped out by random effects
	- Dawkin's proposal thus turns out to be nothing but a further example of assuming what you claim to be proving

- p. 175 **Computer Simulations**
	- evolutionists must be able to demonstrate the existence of von Neumman machine in the wild that bears no signs of design, human, or otherwise.
