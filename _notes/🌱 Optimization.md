### Types of Problems
**Problems:**
- Max Volume
- Max Profit
- Cost of Materials
- Area of Triangle and Square
- Max acceleration
- Shortest distance of point to origin

**How:**
- Find the minimum or maximum value
	1. Find [[ðŸŒ± Critical Points]] in the first derivative (don't forget)
	2. Do a second derivative test to check whether they are concave upwards or concave downwards, refer to [[ðŸŒ± Calculus-based justification]]
