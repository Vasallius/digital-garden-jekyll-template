### No Timelier Time to Pray

#### Scripture

[[John]] 12:20-26

#### Observation

> ❓ What is the theological significance of the group of Greeks seeking Jesus?

As the Greeks came to seek Jesus, it seems that the expansion of God's kingdom is at place. When Jesus said that the death of one koernal wil produce many new kernels, this may be the new kernels, new believers.


#### Application

> ❓ How can I live my life so that praying for the world becomes a daily discipleship journey?

I should be praying for the global expansion of His Kingdom. I should have that desire that more and more people get exposed to the saving grace of Jesus Christ.

#### Prayer

Thank you for waking me up today early, I'm sure there was a reason for that.
