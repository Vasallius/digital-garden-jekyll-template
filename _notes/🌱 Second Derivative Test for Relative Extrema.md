# 🌱 Second Derivative Test for Relative Extrema

## theorem

>💡 *in my own words:* 
If `f''(x)` > 0 and `f'(x)` = 0, then we must have a relative minimum point. On the other hand, if `f''(x)` < 0 and `f'(x)` = 0, then we must have a relative maximum point. However, when `f''(x)` = 0, we do not have a conclusion. It is also to note that the first derivative must be 0 and not be undefined.

See pictures on why we can't derive a conclusion:
