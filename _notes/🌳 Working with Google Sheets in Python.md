## Google Sheets
Google Sheets, the free, web-based spreadsheet application available to anyone with a Google account or Gmail address, has become a useful, feature-rich competitor to Excel. Google Sheets has its own API, but this API can be confusing to learn and use. This chapter covers the [[EZSheets module|EZSheets third-party module]], documented at https://ezsheets.readthedocs.io/. While not as full featured as the official Google Sheets API, EZSheets makes common spreadsheet tasks easy to perform.

A Spreadsheet object will have one or more Sheet objects. The Sheet objects represent the rows and columns of data in each sheet. You can access these sheets using the square brackets operator and an integer index. The Spreadsheet objectâ€™s sheets attribute holds a tuple of Sheet objects in the order in which they appear in the spreadsheet.

Summary:

Google Sheets is a popular online spreadsheet application that runs in your browser. Using the EZSheets third-party module, you can download, create, read, and modify spreadsheets. EZSheets represents spreadsheets as Spreadsheet objects, each of which contains an ordered list of Sheet objects. Each sheet has columns and rows of data that you can read and update in several ways.

While Google Sheets makes sharing data and cooperative editing easy, its main disadvantage is speed: you must update spreadsheets with web requests, which can take a few seconds to execute. But for most purposes, this speed restriction wonâ€™t affect Python scripts using EZSheets. Google Sheets also limits how often you can make changes.
