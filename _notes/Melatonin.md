### Melatonin
Your suprachiasmatic nucleus communicates its repeating signal of night and day to your brain and body using a circulating messenger called
melatonin. Melatonin is called "the vampire hormone"

>*Melatonin acts like a powerful bullhorn, shouting out a clear message
to the brain and body: “It’s dark, it’s dark!” At this moment, we have been served a writ of nightime, and with it, a biological command for the timing of sleep onset.*

Melatonin does not initiate sleep, but it simply just gives the go-signal and encouragement to the body to sleep.
