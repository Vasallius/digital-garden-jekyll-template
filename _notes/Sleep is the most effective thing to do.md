> *Sleep is the most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.*

Sleep is more of a healing station, it heals our body and brain each day. Think of it like a Pokemon Station, the nurse takes your pokemon and brings them back to their original state. To some extent, sleep does that to us, it brings humans back to their healthy state each night.
