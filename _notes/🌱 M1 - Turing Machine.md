- complex decision becoming mechanized
- plugboards used to reprogram the machine physically
- Alan Turing
	- published a paper that addressed hilbert's challenges
	- einstelldungproblem
	- universal machine
	- if (observation)
		- awareness of one symbol
	- then (operation)
		- compare observed symbol to memory (match)
		- perform the task
	- next state
		- jump to next state
		- eventually stop and output result
	- READ ⇒ WRITE ⇒ MOVE
	- no more human input		
	- algorithm and rough work can be together (strip of paper)
	- what can't or can't be written down? what is uncomputable?
