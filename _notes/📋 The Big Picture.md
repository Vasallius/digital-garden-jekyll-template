- aims to talk about the most important stories in the bible

### Day 1 - Psalms 1

- v.1
	- ***blessed*** not a joy from circumstance but a gift from God
	- who you keep in step with affects your path and compass
- v.2
	- meditate on the Bible day and night
	- ***meditate*** = focus on/spend time thinking about (check *Greek*)
	- just like how cows chew on the grass spit the grass and eat back again and again
	- read the bible, think about it , read again, and think about it again
- v.3
	- roots of the tree anchored in waters that keep flowing
	- as a result, their fruit never fails nor their leaves wither
	- ***fruit*** - product of your life (you are the tree)
- v.4
	- wicked = chaff
	- when grain is harvested, chaff is produced
	- harvested throws the grain up in there and the wind blows it away
- v.5-6
	- where our paths lead

Stop and consider the road ahead.
