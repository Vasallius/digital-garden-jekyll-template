> 💡 *in my own words:* 
> Check for values where the denominator would be 0. Take the limit to the left and right of that. If it equals to infinity then we have a vertical asymptote there

Recall horizontal asymptotes:

> 💡 *in my own words:* 
> Take the limit of the function as x approaches ∞ or - ∞. If it results to a constant, then we have a horizontal asymptotes there, if not, we don't have any horizontal asymptote
