### What King of King?

#### Scripture
[[John]] 12:12-15; 19:13-20

**John 12:12-15**
>Jesus’ Triumphant Entry
>12 The next day, the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city. A large crowd of Passover visitors 13 took palm branches and went down the road to meet him. They shouted,
  “Praise God![^1]
  Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
  Hail to the King of Israel!”[^2]
  14 Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, fulfilling the prophecy   that said:
  15 “Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem.
  Look, your King is coming,
  **riding on a donkey’s colt**.”[^3]
  
 [^1]: In Greek, Hosanna. This is an exclamation of praise.
 [^2]:See: [[Psalms]] 118:25-26 and [[Zephaniah]] 3:15
 [^3]: See: [[Zechariah]] 9:9
 
 **John 9:13-20**
 >13 When they said this, Pilate brought Jesus out to them again. Then Pilate sat down on the judgment seat on the platform that is called the Stone Pavement (in Hebrew, Gabbatha). 14 It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover. And Pilate said to the people, “Look, here is your king!”
15 “Away with him,” they yelled. “Away with him! Crucify him!”
“What? Crucify your king?” Pilate asked.
“We have no king but Caesar,” the leading priests shouted back.
16 Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified.
**The Crucifixion**
So they took Jesus away. 17 Carrying the cross by himself, he went to the place called Place of the Skull (in Hebrew, Golgotha). 18 There they nailed him to the cross. Two others were crucified with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them. 19 And Pilate posted a sign on the cross that read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” 20 The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people could read it.

#### Observation

>What observations can you make about the expression, “Behold, your
King”, in verses 12 to 15 and John 19:13-20?

Jesus was riding in a donkey. It was first prophesized in Zephaniah and now it came true. Jesus is a very different King compared to the other Kings in the past. He was a humble King, a King who endured suffering and humiliation from people. Would you ever imagine a King getting crucified for not doing anything despite being able to do so? His death and resurrection signifies that He beat death and rose to life, what other King would you want to serve?

#### Application

>How will I follow the King loyally in His humility, His humiliation and His hiddenness?

I will try to emulate his attributes of humility. Jesus showed that position and power really were insignificant to Him. I think this relates to me a lot because I often envision myself as a king over people and am convicted to be hidden like Jesus.

#### Prayer

Lord, thank you for restoring electricity last night and giving me some good sleep. Lord forgive me for my sins and I know we are called to be Holy, Lord help me. Lord I also pray for humility like Yours, amen.
