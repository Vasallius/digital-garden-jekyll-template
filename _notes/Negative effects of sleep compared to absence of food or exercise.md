One night of bad sleep is so enormous that its effects are more harmful than an absence of food and exercise. This is very alarming. [[https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/how-long-can-you-live-without-food#bodily-response|Studies]] show that a human may approximately live without food for around 21 - 40 days. I believe that humans can live without sleep way lesser.
