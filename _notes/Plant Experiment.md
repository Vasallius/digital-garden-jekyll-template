### Plant Experiment
In 1729, French geophysicist Jean-Jacques d'Ortuos de Marian conducted an experiment on the plant ***[[Mimosa pudica]]***. So what Jean Marian did was that he deprived the plant of sunlight by placing it in a box for the next 24 hours. The experiment showed that the despite being deprived of sunlight, the plant still showed the same characteristic, retracting its leaves when nighttime comes. 

**This proved that living beings have an internal clock called the Circadian Rhythm.**
