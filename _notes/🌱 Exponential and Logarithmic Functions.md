### Exponential Graphs
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20200930111733.png]]
- Both pass point `(0,1)` and asymptotic to the *x-axis*
- We can notice that the range is also from `(0, âˆž )`
- Continuous everywhere, we only need to substitute values
### Logarithmic Graphs
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20200930111946.png]]
- Continuous in the set of positive real numbers
### Laws
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20200930112014.png]]
- Last law is called the **change of base formula**

 ### Euler's Number $e$
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20200930112738.png]]
- Do not be quick to assume that this limit is equal to 1
- âˆž is not a number and as such, 1 cannot be raised by it
- **This limit approaches *e*, approximately equal to 2.7182 or 2.72**

 ### Natural Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

	- 4: [[ðŸŒ± Exponential and Logarithmic Functions#Laws|Change of base formula]] and we set our base to $e$.
	- 5: We plug in (5) into the value of x.
- From here, we can see that any logarithm function can be written in natural logarithm and any exponential function can be written in natural exponential function.
