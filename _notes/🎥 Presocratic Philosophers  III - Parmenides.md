# 🎥 Presocratic Philosophers  III - Parmenides

## parmenides

^e0edc7

- most influential philosopher of pre-socratic
- refuse to think of the world as a rushing river
	- opposite conclusion of [[🎥 Presocratic Philosophers II - Anaximander, Heraclitus#heraclitus of ephesus|heraclitus]]
	- refuse to believe in the motion that takes changes
- a world without any movement or motion
- pure logic
- focusing on now how the world was but how it should be
- truth and illusion
	- **reality is totally different to what it appears to our senses**
- the way of truth
- the way of opinion
- world consisted of only one element, every different thing we see is just an illusion
	- homogenous and uniform ^3d2e54
	- suspended and finite
- "**change is a logical impossbility**"
	- would require an unoccupied space
	- empty space was logical
	- **nowhere for things to come into being or pass away**
	- no motion, all points in the universe must be incontact
		- and thus homogenous
		- fire, earth, air, and water are one and the same
	- thus reality = illusion
		- deceptive senses

## zeno of elea
- student of parminedes
	- **two doorways representing truth and illusion**
- famous paradox
	- Achilles and tortoise
	- would always get closer by 1/2, 1/2, ··· 1/2, thus logically would never catch up to the tortoise  

## plato
- Plato reconciled the view of eternal change and eternal sameness
	- **reason > senses**
	- world of perception = screen of the real and perfect changeless world
		- consisted of perfect and disctinct forms
		- ideas independent of the mind
		- our senses cannot pick this up, only distorted and broken images
			- amateur drawing a painting
			- lacks details
- **"someone who attains pure reason may be able to turn his mind fully away from the world of impermanence and turn it towards perfection or the heavenly"**
