Often times in the middle of the test anxious thoughts and panic attacks may arise. A good technique to combat this is to focus on your breathing. Draw slow and rich breaths. This helps in sending oxygen to critical areas in the brain. Practicing mindfulness as well helps refocus your attention from the bad thoughts to good thoughts rather than suppressing it.
