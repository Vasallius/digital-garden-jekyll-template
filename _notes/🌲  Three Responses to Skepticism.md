## cartesian way
- **The Cartesian Way**
	- *Meditations on First Philosophy*
	- is there anything you can know for sure?
		- your existence?
			- as long as you're thinking you can know for sure that you exist
			- for something to be deceived, it must exist
			- i think, therefore i exist
				- he has a variety of ideas in his mind
					- idea of a bed, a tree, or a cube
				- his greatest idea of all: idea of an infinite and perfect being
					- so amazing that it can't come from an imperfect being
				- **infinite ideas cannot be produced by finite beings**
					- therefore my infinite idea must come from God
					- therefore, God exists
				- if the such a good and all powerful God exists, we can't be permanently deceived
				- an evil demon could not possibly exist in the world of God
			- no global skeptical scenario is possible
			
## russelian way
- **The Russellian Way**
	- different strategy
		- allow that the bad case is possible
		- then give reasons to think it's not actually possible
	- **common-sense hypothesis**
		- simple systematic explanation of regularities
		- fits with instinctive beliefs
			- form a perfectly consistent scientific story
	- reasonable enough to count as knowledge
	- ðŸ”„ counterargument: how are you sure it's simple and systematic?
		- how can you have knowledge whilst having a shadow of doubt

## moorean way
- **The Moorean Way**
	- you don't need God
	- you don't need inference to the best explanation
	- just look at your hands or legs
		- hands are external objects
		- therefore external objects are real
	- i don't have to prove that i have hands
	- i just know
	- you can know things without having to prove them
	- everyday knowledge vs pihlosophical argument
