## Word Documents
Python can create and modify Word documents, which have the .docx file extension, with the [[docx module]].

Word documents have a lot of structure. There are three different data types in a word document. ***Document objects*** represent the whole document. This object contains a list of ***paragraph objects*** . Each paragraph object contains a list of ***run objects***. See figure below.	

See: [[Attributes of run objects]]

Each text in a word document is more than just a string. It contains attributes such as font, color, size, and other information. A ***style*** contains this information. A run object is basically text with the same styles.

### Summary 

---

Word documents are more reliable, and you can read them with the python-docx packageâ€™s docx module. You can manipulate text in Word documents via Paragraph and Run objects. These objects can also be given styles, though they must be from the default set of styles or styles already in the document. You can add new paragraphs, headings, breaks, and pictures to the document, though only to the end.
