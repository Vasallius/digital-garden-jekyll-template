//Life is like a marathon. There are many runners, but only a few are running the race with purpose//

Our purpose is to get the prize that awaits us when we get to heaven. Something of eternal value, it isn't like a trophy or a medal that will soon fade away. It's the [[https://renner.org/devotionals/the-crown-of-righteousness/|Crown of Righteouness]]. Jesus Christ himself will put that victorious crown on top of our heads, signifying that we were faithful until the very end. When we are suffering or thinking of giving up, look up to heaven and think of that crown. Then, stay on the race.
