‚ùì When was the last time you slowed down, unplugged, and relaxed?

I recently rested yesterday, after months of hardwork and strictly following the schedule, rest felt liberating. I did not have to do the stuff I otherwise would be doing. I enjoyed the day more and was not chained to my computer. **I need to rest more.**
