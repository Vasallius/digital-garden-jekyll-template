# 🌱 Points of Inflection

## definitions
Here is the formal definition for points of inflection (POI):

>💡 *in my own words:* 
The function $f$ must be continuous at $x=c$. 
The concavity to the left and right of *c* must change. For example, the graph should be concaved up at the interval `(-∞,c)` then concaved down at `(c,∞)`.

> 💡 *in my own words:* 
If a point is a POI ⇒ `f''(x)` = 0 or undefined but the converse is not true. Even if `f''(x)` = 0 or undefined, the point may not be a point of inflection.

See pictures below where graphs do not have points of inflection:
