This is also known as the "twenty-four-hour" rhythm. This clock is called the ***suprachiasmatic nucelus***. This thing controls biological rhythmic symphony and a vast array of behaviors, including when we want to be awake and asleep.

As observed in the figure, our core temperature drops as the night gets further deeper. This cycle of temperature rise and drop happens despite you being asleep or awake. However, the temperature drop is designed to aid you in falling to sleep.
