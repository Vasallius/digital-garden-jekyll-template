These verses show that it is important to find a place of rest and solitude to connect with God. This renews the way we think and the way we perceive things. This grants us peace that calms our minds and the troubles we may have. The process of praying transforms us to a better person.

The context in which Paul wrote Philippians was when he was in prison. For Paul to write about not being anxious is something very profound as he handles anxiety with prayer and petition and I guess we should too.

‚ùì Today in your quiet space, take 5-10 minutes to think of things that may be bothering you. Each time you think of one, offer it to Jesus in prayer.
