- 3000 BC
  - Chinese abacus was used for arithmetic calculations.
- 1642
  - **Blaise Pascal** created the first adding machine also known as the _Pascaline_
    - it can only add or subtract
- 1660
  - **Gottfried Leibniz** made his own machine that was able to perform the 4 different operations, it was not just limited to addition or subtraction.
    - also invented the binary system that represented numbers 0 and 1
  - A _base_ is basically how many numbers are available in the numbering system.
    - base 2 contained 2 numbers only (binary)
    - base 10 contained the numbers 0-9 (decimal)
    - base 8 was commonly used to represent binary numbers in a shorter form (octal)
    - base 16 was used to represent colors (hexadecimal)
      - 10 decimal numbers(0-9) + 6 letters (A-F)
    - base 256 was able to store values from 0 - 255 and when was commonly used for encoding (e.g. ASCII)
- 1820
  - **Charles Babbage** widely considered as the Father of the Computer
  - In this year, he also created the difference engine
- 1830
  - Babbage then pursued to create the analytical engine
    - considered as the first programmable mechanical computer
    - programmed using punch cards
  - This marked the transition to fully-fledged general purpose computation
  - **Ada Lovelace** was known for her work on Babbage's machine
    - She's also considered as the world's first programmer
    - She made the algorithm for Bernoulli numbers
- 1890
  - **Herman Hollerith** made an electromechanical tabulating machine
    - marked the begining of data processing systems
    - founded a company that eventually became IBM
- 1936
  - **Alan Turing** created the universal machine which was capable of computing anything that is computable
  - modern computers are based from turing
  - **Konrad Zuse** made the first programmable computer
    - This computer used binary/boolean logic to make decisions
- 1937
  - **Howard Aiken** made IBM's Harvard Mark 1 calcualtor machine
    - inspired by babbage difference machine
  - **Grace Hopper** discovered the first bug, a moth that was stuck in a relay
    - coined the term 'debugging'

**Vacuum Tube Era**

- beginning of modern computing
- 1937-1942
  - **John Atanasoff** made the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC)
    - first automatic electronic digital computer
- 1943
  - Colossus was made
    - world's first fully programmable digital computer
- 1946
  - Electrical Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
    - first successful high speed digital computer
- 1950
  - **Von Neumann** made the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC)
    - first stored-program computer
    - 1000 instruction per second
  - also regarded as the father of computer virology
    - self-reproducing computer program

Mechanical -> Electromechanical -> Electrical(Digital)

**Transistor Era**

- 1947
  - first silicon transistor at Bell Labs
- 1954
- TRAnsistor DIgital Computer or TRansistorized Airborne DIgital Computer (TRADIC)
  - first transistorized computer
  - 800 transistors
- Fortran
  - first truly used language
  - **John Backus** at IBM
  - high level language
- 1949
  - assembly language was developed
    - low level language
- 1951
  - Jay Forrester invented the Random Access Magnetic Core Store
    - now known as the RAM
- 1952
  - **Grace Hopper** made the first computer compiler.
  - COBOL language was invented
- 1957 - IBM - first hard-drive - can only store 5 MB -  
  **Integrated Circuit Era**
- 1958
  - **Jack Kilby** made the integrated circuit which consisted of many transistors in one chip
- 1964
  - Douglas Engelbart made the mouse
    - also worked on the first graphical user interface
  - BASIC
    - general-purpose high level language
- 1971
  - floppy disk
  - DRAM by intel
  - C
- 1965
  - Gordon Moore
  - prediction that computing power would double every 2 months
  - cost of computers is halved
  - computers would be so small that it can be embedded into homes, cars and phones
