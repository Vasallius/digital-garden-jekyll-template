In the course of the videos we recapped what the intuitive meaning of a limit was. It is the value of the function as a certain variable approach a certain value very very closely.

It doesn't necessarily mean that `f(x)` would be the limit as it can be undefined of very dettached from the limit, in the situations of a removable discontinuity.

We also know that the limit must approach the value from both sides of `x`, lest the limit would not exist!

We were taught two techniques to evaluate limits that when substitution end up at `0/0`. Those techniques are factoring and rationalization. The goal of these techniques is to cancel a factor in the denominator that would make the function **undefined**.
