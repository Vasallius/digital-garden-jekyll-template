### Chapter 1 - Can We Handle the Truth
- p.36
	- [[Augustine]] was right when he said that we love the truth when it enlightens us, but we hate it when it convicts us. Maybe we can't handle truth.
- p.37
	- truth can be "**that which describes an actual state of affairs**"
	- all truth claims are **absolute**, **narrow**, and **exclusive**
	
##### Truths about truth:
- truth is **discovered** not invented
- truth is **transcultural**; if something is true, it is true for all people, in all places, at all times for everyone, everywhere, at every time
- beliefs **cannot change a fact**, no matter how sincerely they are held
- truth is **not affected by the attitude** of the one professing it
- **all truths are absolute truths**

	- agnostics and skeptics make the truth claim that truth claims cannot be made

- **Truth and Tolerance**
- p.46
	- in our culture today, tolearnce no longer means to put up with something you believe to be false
	- tolerance now means that you're supposed to accept every belief as true
- p.48
	- it is unloving to accept that every belief is true
	- it is unloving to affirm such error that might keep them on the road to damnation
	- instead we are supposed to tell them the truth because it will set them free
