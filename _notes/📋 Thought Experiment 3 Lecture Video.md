## philosophy and God
- not averse to God-talk
- the openness of the discipline allows for critical and reflective thinking
- talks about the concept, not just the person, of God

## concept of God
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023201647.png]]
- Richard Swinburne
	- "God is a disembodied mind with superlative positive characteristics."

## can God create a square-circle?
- square and circles have mutually exclusive properties
- square-circle are logical impossiblities
- üîÑ: Since God is above everything, he would be able to tweak everything is still preserve consistency right?
	- what makes a square and circle are analytical statements, see: [[üå≤  Thought Experiment 2 Lecture Video#3 types of statements|types of statements]]
- üîÑ: miracles have happened in the past
	- false
	- miracles are different to a logical impossibility
	- creating a square-circle is not a miraculous activity
	- we cannot account for miracles, that's why we attribute them to God
	- **miracles do not defy logic**
- laws of logic are different from laws of nature
- logical impossibility cannot possibly take a physical form

## omnipotence
- C.S. Lewis
	- Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracle to Him, but not nonsense.
- why are restrictions possible?
	- derived from confluence of all the superlative qualities
	- omnirationality and logicality denies God

## 3 possible solutions to the dilemma
- God does not exist. The concept of God is also a logical impossibility.
- God is either all-powerful or all-logical.
- God is the whole pie. All of his attributes are the slices of the same pie.

## is the belief justified
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023203803.png]]
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023203900.png]]
- cosmological argument
- teleological argument
- argument from miracles and religious experience
- ontological argument
- wagers

	- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023222816.png]]
	- evolution can be used to explain design
	- see invisible gardener thought experiment
	- probability, not necessity
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023223000.png]]
	- üîÑ: implies a miracle worker, not necessarily God
	- üîÑ: violation of a natural law
- ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20201023223213.png]]
	- fake religious experiences
