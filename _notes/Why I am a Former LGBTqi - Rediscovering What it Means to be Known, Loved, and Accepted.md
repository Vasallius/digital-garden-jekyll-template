Panelists: Lizza Juarez, Ali Kennedy
- Her Story:
	- Lesbian since grade 3 in a Christian school
	- became the center piece of who I was
	- "I was born this way"
	- "Bible restricted me to live happily"
	- Sept 9 - relationship started with a girl
		- years went by and I became empty and depressed
	-  felt very opressed because can't share identity with family
	- deeply convinced that it was her identity
	-  come out in billboard
		-  night before it was launched, i was very depressed
		-  wanted to take my life away
		-  i got this magical irresistible desire to actually read the Bible
			-  i didn't want to read this because i felt offended whenver i read this
		- Verse of the Day : Philippians 4:6-7
		- that day changed my life
		- i felt **peace**, **love**, and **acceptance**
		- i've longed for this for so long, i finally experienced it
	- my world turned upside down
	- God wasn't a tyrant that demanded me to give up everything i clung into
	- He is a loving God
	- my sexuality does not define me
	- In the book, "Openness and Healing", "*sexual orientation*" creates false identity and robs us of who we truly are.
	
	---
	
	### If we are not our sexuality, then who are we truly?
	
	### How then are we to understand our sexuality in light of who we truly are?
	
	1. Creation
		- God created everything from nothing
		- Everything he had made was very good
		- 6th day - created man (crown of his creation)
		- man was created in the image and likeness of God
		- man was supposed to represent God
		- Genesis 2:18 
			- man was alone, that's why woman was created
			- very first marriage
			- marriage was between man and woman
			- sexuality was specifically designed to flourish and multiply
			- perfect relationship with each other and with God, embracing different roles and identities, complementing each other
	2. Fall 
		- one rule: don't eat in the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
		- will we submit or rebel?
		- Satan entered the garden in a form of a serpent and deceived these people into believing that God was withholding something good from them
		- human depended on themselves
		- man and human were no longer perfect, tainted with sin
		- relationship with God was broken
		- the design for man and human were corrupted
		- now sexuality, marriage, and purpose have been distorted
		- Andrew Walker, the bible story isn't left in the past tense, it's in the present tense, it has made it's way into you and me
		- Sin is the greatest equalizer , and the punishment for sin is death
	3.  Redemption
		- World has been corrupt, mankind has been sinful
		- resulting into separation to God
		- we are all spiritually dead
		- humanity is in a downward spiral
		- humanity is hopeless
		- unless someone intervenes.....
			- someone who is holy
			- someone who is human
				- so he can represent humanity
			- this is Jesus Christ
			- lived a sinless life
			- tempted, but never waivered
			- obedient even to the point of death
			- greatest exchange happened in the Cross
			- he suffered not because of His sin but because of the sins of people He loves
		- Christ to suffer for our sins to bring us back to Him

### What does the Gospel have to do with our sexuality?

- things like my sexuality were not the root problem, my sin was
- ‚ÄúThere is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of each man which cannot be satisfied by any created thing but only by God the Creator, made know through Jesus Christ.‚Äù - [[Blaise Pascal]]
- by grace we are saved, there is no amount of sin that God can never forgive
- same message: repent and turn from your self-sufficient ways
- he does not save people to become a heterosexual, to find fulness in life of God

### Q&A:

‚ùì What if I don't share your worldview? Why can't you just let us be?  What's wrong with a permanent and stable same-sex relationship?

üîç The good in something doesn't make it right in God's sight. The permanent and stable relationship that we ought to have is a relationship with Jesus Christ.

üîç Sexuality has become a human right, how can we deny themseves of this right? Sexuality isn't a right, it's a gift, given in a specific context. Rediscover the purpose why God created sex. Why would he restrict something so beautiful between only a man and a woman? First purpose: procreation to steward His creation. Second purpose: intimacy and delight through sex. Third purpose: symbolize the Church and Christ, them coming together = Christ's love for the church. Marriage and sex is meant to mean something and ultimately represent Christ's love for the Church.
 
üîç Having known a life with Jesus, Jesus sought me and came to save the lost. I want to share it with other people. We can be the mouthpiece so that people can hear. It's still their choice. If you find a goldmine, you share it right?

‚ùì You as a Christian, how do you respond to an LGBTqi person that doens't share your conviction. Why is there such a tension of homosexuality in the church ?

üîç What's so wrong with something that feels so good? Address by the reference point for morality. An example: angry man that feels good to shoot a person. It's a dangerous line of thinking when our basis for morality is emotionally-driven. We believe that morality is given from God.

üîç Starting the fall, our desires have been against God. Our thinking is inclined to think stuff against God's Word. If we put fallen people and let them choose worldly stuff and a holy God, the person would choose worldly stuff because of our nature. Sin will present itself to you in the most appealing way, because again, we are sinful. Only the Cross of Jesus Christ will satisfy us and give us a new nature.

üîç You cannot give cure to a person who is not seeking self. Assess the person, is she looking for truth? looking for a pain-reliever? Adapt your response depending on the context of the scenario. Make the church welcoming. We don't see people at first, we see people who need Jesus.

‚ùì Is the church homophobic? How can the church leaders help same-sex attracting people? How do we be welcoming?

üîç The Church needs to get into this concern and be able to embrace so that we can embrace those who are struggling. There should be a balance.

üîç The church shouldn't be homophobic. The church is a bit confused. I'm sorry in behalf of the church because we haven't loved people well. Jesus was radically inclusive, he accepted everyone irregardless. We are meant to embody that kind of attitude. Embrace every single type of human being. We've elevated homosexual sins to a special sin. When in fact, all sins our in equal ground. First thing church can do, is to normalize human struggle.

üîç Present sin as missing the mark, missing the standard of God. Present sin as sin. Build the relationship and make them see that you really love them despite if you're their gonna be a Christian or not. Love them as God loved you.

‚ùì Why are church people so pumped up making lesbians straight? Can lesbians serve the Church? Can I be Christian and still be gay?

üîç There will always be a struggle to holiness and righteouness to be like Christ.

üîç When you choose to have a life of Jesus, it is not matter of coming out of homosexuality and becoming a heterosexual. Our identity is who God calls us to be. We have specific roles. The steoreotyping of acting who you are supposed to be. People expect an overnight change, when people have grown up with homosexuality and it's been a learned habit and lifestyle. 

üîç It's a journey. We're all in the road of sanctification. Whether we are a homosexual or heterosexual, we must consider what we our basing our thoughts and identity on. Continuous evaluation of our lifestyle to who we are supposed to be. 

‚ùì How did you deal with your friends? "You're such a hypocrite!" How do you handle this	?

üîç I used to force people into Christianity, I lost a lot of friends along the way. But eventually, I was humbled by God. The friends who stayed with me told me that I was *self-righteous*. I will still continue to love them as Christ has loved me. Pray for these people and an opportunity to be able to share the Gospel. Remove in the heads that we don't have to treat them as someone we want to convert. We treat them as a human being made in the image of God.

üîç Christians have this feeling of letting LGBT people know that they are living in sin. "How do I share the truth without condemning?" "How to be friends with LGBT people without compromising the truth?" Even with genuine intentions, we may come off across as someone condescending. This isn't effective and does not reflect Jesus. Christians, relax a bit and learn to love and serve people. Learn to genuinely know people. Be a human to a human.

‚ùì I was born with it. It's because of the culture. It's a part of who you are. What's the root cause of homosexuality?

üîç Be careful in diagnosing people. Simple root is that we are sinful people.

üîç Homosexuality is not a new thing. It happened way back. It's because of the evil deeds of man's heart. We come up with stuff that aren't pleasurable with God, like homosexuality. Why is my struggle homosexuality, and not drug addiction? pornography?
