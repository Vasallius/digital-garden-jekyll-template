#### Devotional: Your Best Self
- Speaker: Max

authenticity
self-actualization
doing things my way = feelings

[[Luke]] 19:1-10
**v. 1-2** Zacchaeus was rich and a tax collector. Probably corrupt. Money was what drove Zaccaheus, how about us? What is driving us?
**v. 3-4** There is a hole inside of him. Money cannot complete him and fulfill him. When we try to fulfill ourselves from stuff in the world, it won't be enough. Something is gonna be missing. He makes the decision to see Jesus, and Jesus sees him.
**v. 5-6** Jesus calls him to come down, not just from the tree. Come down from the way you are living your life. He accepted the invitation and his whole life was transformed.

Jesus wants us to be our best self. When we surrender, we become more and more like Jesus. 

#### Keynote Talk: Why Trust the Bible?
- Speaker: Alex Stark

Bible is a divine book.
Bible is a historical book.

Trust the Bible for what?

People think that gospel is more of a myth or a legend than history. 
- The gospels were way too early for myth and legend to creep in.
	- Only few people should know the story. But a lot of people have heard it and experienced it. There are still people who can confirm the retelling.
	- The teachings of Jesus were passed down to communities and nations.
	- Around 35-55 years after he died, the gospels were written down. They were still a bunch of well-known people that you can ask and can confirm what the Gospel said.
	- Over 500 eye-witnesses.
	- The Gospel spread too widely not to be checked and fact-checked
- What if the eye-witnesses were lying? What reason do we have to trust these people?
	- The details are too historically accurate to be dismissed.
		- two ways to figure out:
		- see for external sources at the same time which contradict the source
		- study the details of the Bible themselves, check if they are accuratee
	- expansion on detail 2:
		- archaeology keeps uncovering places that the Bible mentions
			- See: John 9
	- Christianity is a decision you can make **because** of evidence.

#### Big Questions - Doesn't the Bible contradict Science?

Yutaro

Science is amazing and often enriches our life. Science has certain limits. Science explains how and mechanism but it doesn't always give us answer on deepest questions of life like meaning and purpose.

Don't contradict but compliment.

The existence of biological information dictates that there is an intellgent higher being that designed us.

#### Live  Q & A - Max and Clive

![[Pasted image 223.png]]

There is a lot of political division. The message of Jesus christ is epipolitcal (above or before) politics. You can't use the gospel to affiliate the gospel to a political party. They are all intrinsically broken, since human beings are broken. What Chrstians are called to do are to reach out to people who have been oppressed. They reduce the message of Jesus to the political arena.

it isn't homosexuality is wrong and heterosexuality is right. The Bible has a particular design for marriage and sexual activity.
