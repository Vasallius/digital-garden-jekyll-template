	- This goes by the highfalutin name of Dirichlet’s Pigeonhole Principle or as Dirichlet called it Schubfachprinzip. 
	- If you’ve got  m  places to put things, and at most  `n`  things can go in any of those  `m`  places, you can put at most  `mn`  things in those places altogether. 
	- It follows that if you have more than  `mn`  things to put in  m  places, then at least one of the places will have more than  `n`  things in it.
- most flexible, can be used in non conditional forms
