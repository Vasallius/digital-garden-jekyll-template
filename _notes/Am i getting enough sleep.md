### Am i getting enough sleep

**Matthew Walker** gives us two simple questions to assess whether we are getting enough sleep r not
>First, after waking up in the morning,could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.? **If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality.** 


> Second, can you function optimally without caffeine before noon? If the answer is “no,” then you are most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.

>When you don’t get enough sleep, one consequence among many is that adenosine concentrations remain too high. Like an outstanding debt on a loan, come the morning, some quantity of yesterday’s adenosine remains. You then carry that outstanding sleepiness balance throughout the following day. **Also like a loan in arrears, this sleep debt will continue to accumulate. You cannot hide from it. The debt will roll over into the next payment cycle, and the next, and the next, producing a condition of prolonged, chronic sleep deprivation from one day to another.**

I would like to compare it to game addiction. As we continue to play a game, we continue to immerse in that world and spend more time in it, creating a loop that only causes harm.
