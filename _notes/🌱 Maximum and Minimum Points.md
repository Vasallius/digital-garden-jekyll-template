Global maximum and global minimum are the lowest and highest points in the function. But, we can also have local minima and maxima. There are points that are lower or higher than its surrounding points.

Determining maximum and minimum points start with finding out [[ðŸŒ± Critical Points]]. After which we have to check the `sign` of the slope before and after approaching the [[ðŸŒ± Critical Points|critical point.]]

##### Relative Local Extrema

We know that `f(c)` is a relative **maximum** if `f(c)` is greater than or equal to `f(x)` for all x in (c-h,c+h) for h>0.

We know that `f(d)` is a relative **minimum** if `f(d)` is greater than or equal to `f(x)` for all x in (d-h,d+h) for h>0

>Take note: Do not test points that will go pass another critical point.

##### Absolute Global Extrema

We test the critical points **and** the endpoints, since the endpoints can be the highest and lowest points of the function.
