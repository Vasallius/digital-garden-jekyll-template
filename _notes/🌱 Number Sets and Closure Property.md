## Number Sets
- Natural Numbers: ℕ 
	- whole numbers from 0 
	- counting and ordering
	- for our course, we consider 0 as a natural number
- Integers: ℤ 
	- positive and negative whole numbers + 0
	- "Zahlen" german word meaning numbers
	- Z+ only positive integers
	- Z- only negative integers
- Rational Numbers: ℚ 
	- ratio of two integers
	- fractions
	- "quotient"
	- $r=\frac{p}{q}$, provided that q is not equal to 0
	- consistency, always use lowest terms
- Irrational Numebers:
	- cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers
		- square root of 2
		- pi
		- e
- Real Numbers: ℝ
	-  includes ℚ and irrational numbers
	-  any point on the number line
- Complex Numbers: ℂ 
	-  square root of a negative number
	- i
	-  real plus imaginary
		-  *a + bi*

## Closure Property 
-  set S is closed if \* operation is performed on the any members of the set S and returns a member of the set S
-  ℤ closed under **+, -,  and x**
	-  not closed under **/**

- ❗ ==**sets are generally closed under addition and multiplication**==
	-  Sample Invokation
	- integer n is even if there exists an integer k, such that n = 2k
	- **we can assure k is an integer** since it is a product/sum of other variables
- ❓ Prove the statement: The product of two even integers is even
