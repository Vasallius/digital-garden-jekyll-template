Be aware of non-verbal cues, like signs of boredom. Communication is **mostly** composed of non-verbal communication, that's why we really need to pay attention. Plus, we can see them during calls, check if they are listening or if they are becoming busy doing something else.  Address them propery and keep the discussion going and fun. Maybe the discussion is too heavy and "boring", try starting to ask [[Application Questions]].
