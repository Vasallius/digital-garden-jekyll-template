- ## The Formal Definition of a Limit
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200924114541.png)
	- proving
		- choose a delta
			- 0 < f(x) < epsilon
			- 0 < x-a < delta
			- delta would be expressed as epsilon since the two inequalities are similar
			- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200924115045.png)
		- verify that chosen delta works
			- express f(x) as an inequality less than delta instead of epsilon
			- substitute the value of delta
				- this yields to epsilon

- ## Continuity at a Point
	- ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200924115521.png) 
	- **domain of all polynomial functions is all real numbers**
		- continuous at the set of all real numbers
	- **domain of rational functions is all real numbers except for x that makes the function undefined**
		- discontinuous at that point
	- for rational and polynomial functions if f(a) is defined then the f is continuous at x = a
	- **discontinuities**
		- removable
			- limit exists but f(a) is undefined or not equal to the limit
		- essential
			- limit does not exist because limits are not equal
			- jump essential
			- infinite essential
	- if f(a) is defined and limit is equal to f(a), function is continuous
- ## Continuity on an Interval
	-  ![](Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020200924120821.png)
	-  continuous from the   left/right if f(a) is equal to the limit as it approaches x from left or right

	-  function discontinuous at numbers where it is undefined
		-  possibly end points of piece wise functions
