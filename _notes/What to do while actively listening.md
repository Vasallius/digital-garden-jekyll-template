### What to do while actively listening
While [[Immersion|actively listening]], we should be paying attention to the sounds of the language, without worrying about understanding what they actually mean first. If you hear a word that you might wanna [[Should i look things up|look up]], look it up.

>But this is simply par for the course in language learning. The only way to reach a point of true understanding is to first go through a lot of not understanding

Analogy to the Pokemon Game: It is very boring especially the grinding part, however the small victories and joy you get by accomplishing challenges make you continue to play the game. That is what makes it fun. That's why don't quit.
