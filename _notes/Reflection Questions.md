>They ask the question, "What does this have to do with us?" or "Why was this included in the Bible?"

As the name suggests, these questions make us reflect or think about the current state of events or issues that happen in a day to day basis. It may be reflections about our own life, other people's life, or even the life of the church. These questions try to contextualize whatever is in the text to our lives. With reflection people often mention [[Application Questions|how they would apply it in their lives.]]
