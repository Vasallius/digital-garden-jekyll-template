1. Loop through the sheet skipping first row since first row contains titles of the table


2. Assign the cell value to variable `produceName`


3. Check if produce name is in `PRICE_UPDATES` dictionary. If it is update the cell to the value in the `PRICE_UPDATE` dictionary

4. Save a copy of the workbook, not overwriting the existing workbook.
