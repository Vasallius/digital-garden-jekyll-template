- Circular functions are not normally one-to-one
- **That's why we have to restrict their domain in such a way that they are one-to-one on that domain**

### Inverse Sine Function

- after restricting the domain

	- as you can see, the graph now passes the horizontal line test
- inverse

### Example
 - ![[Attachments/Pasted image 20200930115126.png]]
 - there are infinitely many solution but since we have a restricted domain we know that there is only one solution

- inverse functions can also be denoted by Arcsin, Arcos, Arctan, ...

	- as we can see limits at end points can only approach either from the left or right
